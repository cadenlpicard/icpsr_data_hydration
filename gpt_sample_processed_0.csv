Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The extract files version of
NIBRS was created to simplify working with NIBRS data. Data management
issues with NIBRS are significant, especially when two or more segment

data analysis. NIBRS data as formatted by the FBI are stored in a
single file. These data are organized by various segment levels
(record types). There are six main segment levels: administrative,
offense, property, victim, offender, and arrestee. Each segment level
has a different length and layout. There are other segment levels that
occur with less frequency than the six main levels. Significant
computing resources are necessary to work with the data in its
single-file format. In addition, the user must be sophisticated in
working with data in complex file types. For these reasons and the

 surveys of consumers conducted annually since 1946. In a nationally
 representative sample, the head of each spending unit (usually the
 husband, the main earner, or the owner of the home) was interviewed.

 some family data are also available. The questions in the 1956 survey
 covered the respondent's attitudes toward national economic conditions
 and price activity, as well as the respondent's own financial
 situation. Other questions examined the spending unit head's
 occupation, and the nature and amount of the spending unit's income,
 debts, liquid assets, changes in liquid assets, savings, investment
 preferences, and actual and expected purchases of cars and other major
 durables. The survey also elicited respondent's attitudes about
 different methods of using income remaining after expenses were met,
 e.g., investing in stocks or putting money in savings. In addition,
 the survey explored in detail the subject of housing, e.g., previous
 and present home ownership, value of respondent's dwelling, and
 mortgage information.  Other questions inquired into the part-time and
 full-time employment status of the spouse and other earners who were
 not the head. Questions about consumer debt covered its purpose and
 source. Personal data include number of people in the spending unit,

28044,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the Safe City crime prevention model that was implemented in designated retail areas in jurisdictions across the United States. The model involved frequent meetings and information-sharing among the police, Target, and neighboring retailers, along with the implementation of enhanced technology.  The first step in the Safe City evaluation involved selecting evaluation sites.  The final sites selected were Chula Vista, California, and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Next, for each of the two sites, researchers selected a site that had a potential for crime displacement caused by the intervention area, and a matched comparison area in another jurisdiction that would likely have been selected as a Safe City site.  For Chula Vista, the displacement area was 2 miles east of the intervention area and the comparison area was in Houston, Texas.  For Cincinnati, the displacement area was 1.5 miles north of the intervention area and the comparison area was in Buffalo, New York.  In Chula Vista, the Safe City intervention activities were focused on gaining a better understanding of the nature and underlying causes of the crime and disorder problems occurring in the designated Safe City site, and strengthening pre-existing partnerships between law enforcement and businesses affected by these problems.  In Cincinnati, the Safe City intervention activities centered on increasing business and citizen awareness, communication, and involvement in crime control and prevention activities.  The research team collected pre- and post-intervention crime data from local police departments (Part 1) to measure the impact of the Safe City initiatives in Chula Vista and Cincinnati.  The 981 records in Part 1 contain monthly crime counts from January 2004 to November 2008 for various types of crime in the retail areas that received the intervention in Chula Vista and Cincinnati, and their corresponding displacement zones and matched comparison areas.  Using the monthly crime counts contained in the Safe City Monthly Crime Data (Part 1) and estimations of the total cost of crime to society for various offenses from prior research, the research team calculated the total cost of crimes reported during the month/year for each crime type that was readily available (Part 2).  The 400 records in the Safe City Monthly Cost Benefit Analysis Data (Part 2) contain monthly crime cost estimates from January 2004 to November 2008 for assaults, burglaries, larcenies, and robberies in the retail areas that received the intervention in Chula Vista and Cincinnati, and their corresponding displacement zones and matched comparison areas.  The research team also received a total of 192 completed baseline and follow-up surveys with businesses in Chula Vista and Cincinnati in 2007 and 2008 (Part 3).  The surveys collected data on merchants' perceptions of crime and safety in and around businesses located in the Safe City areas.  The Safe City Monthly Crime Data (Part 1) contain seven variables including the number of crimes in the target area, the month and year the crime was committed, the number of crimes in the displacement area, the number of crimes in a comparable area in a comparable city, the city, and the crime type.  The Safe City Monthly Cost Benefit Analysis Data (Part 2) contain seven variables including the cost of the specified type of crime occurring in the target area, the month and year the cost was incurred, the cost of the specified type of crime in the displacement area, the cost of the specified type of crime in a matched comparison area, the city, and the crime type. The Safe City Business Survey Data (Part 3) contain 132 variables relating to perceptions of safety, contact with local police, experience and reporting of crime, impact of crime, crime prevention, community connections, and business/employee information.","['safe city model', 'crime prevention', 'retail areas', 'police collaboration', 'technology implementation', 'evaluation sites', 'crime displacement', 'cost analysis', 'merchant perceptions', 'community involvement']","['community policing', 'crime prevention', 'crime statistics', 'criminal justice policy', 'criminal justice system', 'law enforcement agencies', 'police community relations', 'public safety', 'technology transfer', 'victim services']","safe city model,retail areas,police collaboration,technology implementation,evaluation sites,crime displacement,merchant perceptions"

37470,"<p> In the United States, a number of challenges prevent an accurate assessment of the prevalence of hate crimes in different areas of the country. These challenges create huge gaps in knowledge about hate crime--who is targeted, how, and in what areas--which in turn hinder appropriate policy efforts and allocation of resources to the prevention of hate crime. In the absence of high-quality hate crime data, online platforms may provide information that can contribute to a more accurate estimate of the risk of hate crimes in certain places and against certain groups of people. Data on social media posts that use hate speech or internet search terms related to hate against specific groups has the potential to enhance and facilitate timely understanding of what is happening offline, outside of traditional monitoring (e.g., police crime reports). This study assessed the utility of Twitter data to illuminate the prevalence of hate crimes in the United States with the goals of (i) addressing the lack of reliable knowledge about hate crime prevalence in the U.S. by (ii) identifying and analyzing online hate speech and (iii) examining the links between the online hate speech and offline hate crimes. </p>
<p> The project drew on four types of data: recorded hate crime data, social media data, census data, and data on hate crime risk factors. An ecological framework and Poisson regression models were adopted to study the explicit link between hate speech online and hate crimes offline.

present in Egypt, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Israel, Canada, Brazil,
Russia, Haiti, Bosnia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia,
China, France, the Baltic nations, South Korea, Poland, South Africa,
Taiwan, Cuba, India, Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. A series of
questions addressed potential threats to those vital
interests. Additional topics covered the foreign policy goals of the
United States, bloodshed in the 21st century, measures to combat
international terrorism, the United States' commitment to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United States' contributions
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United States
involvement in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Respondents
were asked to rate their feelings toward Great Britain, Saudi Arabia,
China, France, Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba, Argentina, Pakistan,
Nigeria, Turkey, Italy, Russia, North Korea, Germany, Iran, Japan,
Mexico, Israel, Iraq, India, Canada, and Brazil. Respondents were also
asked for their opinions of President Bill Clinton, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Pope John Paul
II, former President George Bush, former President Jimmy Carter,
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, South African President Nelson
Mandela, European Union President Jacques Santer, Cuban President
Fidel Castro, Chinese President Jiang Zemin, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat, French President
Jacques Chirac, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic. Further
queries focused on whether United States troops should be used if
North Korea invaded South Korea, if Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia, if Arab
forces invaded Israel, if Russia invaded Poland, if the Cuban people
attempted to overthrow the Castro regime, if China invaded Taiwan, or
if Serbian forces killed large numbers of ethnic
Albanians. Respondents were asked whether they supported the use of
economic sanctions against Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and
China. Additional topics covered the elimination of tariffs,
globalization, the establishment of a Palestinian state, the United
States' role as a world leader, United States federal government
program spending, and whether the United States should pay the $1.6
billion owed to the United Nations. Opinion leaders were asked an
additional question about the possible threat of the ""euro"" (the
unified monetary system to be implemented in January 1999 by the
European Union) to the United States dollar's supremacy as a reserve
currency. Background information on general public respondents
includes age, race, sex, political party, political orientation,
religion, marital status, spouse's employment status, age of children
in household, amount of time spent at home, employment status,
occupation, position in household, education, home ownership status,
and household income. Background information on opinion leaders

orientation.","['foreign policy', 'public opinion', 'opinion leaders', 'presidential candidates', 'economic aid', 'international relations', 'national security', 'global threats', 'united nations', 'monetary policy']","['economic aid', 'foreign policy', 'international relations', 'monetary policy', 'national security', 'presidential candidates', 'public opinion', 'united nations', 'international conflict', 'international cooperation']","opinion leaders,global threats"
7896,"This data collection contains information from the first
wave of High School and Beyond (HSB), a longitudinal study of American
youth conducted by the National Opinion Research Center on behalf of
the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Data were
collected from 58,270 high school students (28,240 seniors and 30,030
sophomores) and 1,015 secondary schools in the spring of 1980. Many
items overlap with the NCES's NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF THE CLASS
OF 1972 (ICPSR 8085). The HSB study's data are contained in eight
files. Part 1 (School Data) contains data from questionnaires
completed by high school principals about various school attributes
and programs. Part 2 (Student Data) contains data from surveys
administered to students. Included are questionnaire responses on
family and religious background, perceptions of self and others,
personal values, extracurricular activities, type of high school
program, and educational expectations and aspirations. Also supplied
are scores on a battery of cognitive tests including vocabulary,
reading, mathematics, science, writing, civics, spatial orientation,
and visualization. To gather the data in Part 3 (Parent Data), a
subsample of the seniors and sophomores surveyed in HSB was drawn, and
questionnaires were administered to one parent of each of 3,367
sophomores and of 3,197 seniors. The questionnaires contain a number
of items in common with the student questionnaires, and there are a
number of items in common between the parent-of-sophomore and the
parent-of-senior questionnaires. This is a revised file from the one
originally released in Autumn 1981, and it includes 22 new
analytically constructed variables imputed by NCES from the original
survey data gathered from parents. The new data are concerned
primarily with the areas of family income, liabilities, and
assets. Other data in the file concentrate on financing of
post-secondary education, including numerous parent opinions and
projections concerning the educational future of the student,
anticipated financial aid, student's plans after high school, expected
ages for student's marriage and childbearing, estimated costs of
post-secondary education, and government financial aid policies. Also
supplied are data on family size, value of property and other assets,
home financing, family income and debts, and the age, sex, marital,
and employment status of parents, plus current income and expenses for
the student. Part 4 (Language Data) provides information on each
student who reported some non-English language experience, with data
on past and current exposure to and use of languages. In Parts 5-6,
there are responses from 14,103 teachers about 18,291 senior and
sophomore students from 616 schools. Students were evaluated by an
average of four different teachers who had the opportunity to express
knowledge or opinions of HSB students whom they had taught during the
1979-1980 school year. Part 5 (Teacher Comment Data: Seniors)
contains 67,053 records, and Part 6 (Teacher Comment Data: Sophomores)
contains 76,560 records. Questions were asked regarding the teacher's
opinions of their student's likelihood of attending college,
popularity, and physical or emotional handicaps affecting school
work. The sophomore file also contains questions on teacher
characteristics, e.g., sex, ethnic origin, subjects taught, and time
devoted to maintaining order. The data in Part 7 (Twins and Siblings
Data) are from students in the HSB sample identified as twins,
triplets, or other siblings. Of the 1,348 families included, 524 had
twins or triplets only, 810 contained non-twin siblings only, and the
remaining 14 contained both types of siblings. Finally, Part 8
(Friends Data) contained the first-, second-, and third-choice friends
listed by each of the students in Part 2, along with identifying
information allowing links between friendship pairs.","['longitudinal study', 'american youth', 'data collection', 'high school students', 'cognitive tests', 'parent questionnaires', 'family income', 'teacher evaluations', 'sibling data', 'friendship networks']","['adolescents', 'cognitive tests', 'educational assessment', 'family income', 'high school students', 'longitudinal study', 'parent-child relationship', 'school readiness', 'teacher evaluations', 'youth development']","longitudinal study,american youth,data collection,cognitive tests,parent questionnaires,teacher evaluations,sibling data,friendship networks"

Angeles District Attorney's Office to examine the effectiveness of
specialized prosecutorial activities in dealing with the local problem
of rising gang violence, in particular the special gang prosecution
unit Operation Hardcore. One part of the evaluation was a system
performance analysis. The purposes of this system performance analysis
were (1) to describe the problems of gang violence in Los Angeles and
the ways that incidents of gang violence were handled by the Los
Angeles criminal justice system, and (2) to document the activities of
Operation Hardcore and its effect on the criminal justice system's
handling of the cases prosecuted by that unit. Computer-generated
listings from the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office of all
individuals referred for prosecution by local police agencies were used
to identify those individuals who were subsequently prosecuted by the
District Attorney. Data from working files on all cases prosecuted,
including copies of police, court, and criminal history records as well
as information on case prosecution, were used to describe criminal
justice handling. Information from several supplementary sources was
also included, such as the automated Prosecutors Management Information
System (PROMIS) maintained by the District Attorney's Office, and court
records from the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles County,
the local felony court.","['gang violence', 'prosecutorial effectiveness', 'operation hardcore', 'system performance analysis', 'los angeles', 'criminal justice system', 'data analysis', 'prosecution activities', 'promis system', 'court records']","['criminal justice system', 'court records', 'data analysis', 'gang violence', 'los angeles', 'operation hardcore', 'prosecutorial effectiveness', 'prosecution activities', 'system performance analysis', 'promis system']","prosecutorial effectiveness,operation hardcore,system performance analysis,los angeles,data analysis,prosecution activities,promis system,court records"
2035,"This data collection is part of a series of nationwide
 surveys conducted from October 1990 to June 1996 in Spain. The
 questionnaires for each of these surveys consisted of three
 sections. The first section collected information on respondents'
 attitudes regarding personal, national, and international issues, and
 included questions on respondents' level of life satisfaction and
 frequency of visits with relatives, neighbors, and friends. The second
 section contained a topical module of questions that varied from
 survey to survey, with this survey's topic focusing on political and
 economic culture. The survey gauged attitudes concerning distributive
 justice, opinions on economic and labor policies, and opinions on the
 state of the Spanish economy and the desired form of government for
 Spain. In addition, respondents were queried about their personal
 financial situations, political participation, and voting behavior.
 Questions in the third section of the questionnaire elicited
 socioeconomic information, such as respondent's sex, age, marital
 status, size of household, occupation, education, religion,
religiosity, place of birth, and income.","['nationwide surveys', 'spain demographics', 'life satisfaction', 'social interactions', 'political attitudes', 'economic opinions', 'distributive justice', 'personal finances', 'political participation', 'socioeconomic data']","['economic attitudes', 'life satisfaction', 'personal finances', 'political attitudes', 'political participation', 'public opinion', 'social interactions', 'socioeconomic data', 'socioeconomic status', 'voter participation']","nationwide surveys,spain demographics,social interactions,economic opinions,distributive justice,socioeconomic data"

34468,"This poll, fielded August 2011, and the second of four, is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public opinion on a range of political and social issues. This particular poll surveyed respondents living in New York City. Respondents were asked their opinion on Mayor Michael Bloomberg's job performance and whether they approved of his handling of the public school system. Respondents were also queried on general aspects of their lives in New York City, including opinions on their long range view of the city's livability, opinions on the city's economy, whether they had plans to relocate, and whether they held a good or bad image of the city. Respondents were also asked to provide opinions on the state of New York City public schools, including views on the New York City teachers union and charter schools, assessments of the overall quality of public education, whether quality had improved under Mayor Bloomberg, and whether they approved of Dennis Walcott's job performance as school system Chancellor. The poll also features several questions related to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. Respondents were asked whether security initiatives implemented following the terrorist attacks had enhanced public safety at New York City airports, bridges, tunnels, subways and nuclear power plants in the region. Further opinions were solicited on whether respondents felt New Yorkers had recovered economically and emotionally from the attacks, whether first responders and families of victims had been treated fairly, and whether the killing of Osama bin Laden had provided a sense of closure and increased safety. Furthermore, respondents were asked to gauge the likelihood of another attack within the upcoming months, whether they felt safe or endangered living in New York City, and whether they perceived the threat of terrorism to be higher in New York City when compared to other United States cities. Further information was collected regarding respondents feelings toward Muslims following the September 11th attacks, whether respondents believed Muslims are unfairly singled out, and whether they believed Muslims and Arab Americans are more sympathetic to terrorists than other American citizens. Additional topics included the possible opening of Wal-Mart stores within New York City, the planned redevelopment of the site at Ground Zero, and the proposed mosque and Islamic community center two blocks from Ground Zero.

1329,"Human capital growth, defined as the change in the fraction
of a metropolitan area's labor force with a bachelor's degree, is
typically viewed as generating a number of desirable outcomes,
including economic growth. Yet, in spite of its importance, few
empirical studies have explored why some economies accumulate more
human capital than others. This paper attempts to do so using a sample
of more than 200 metropolitan areas in the United States over the
years 1980, 1990, and 2000. The results reveal two consistently
significant correlates of human capital growth: population and the
existing stock of college-educated labor. Given that population growth
and human capital growth are both positively associated with
education, these results suggest that the geographic distributions of
population and human capital should have become more concentrated in
recent decades. That is, larger, more-educated metropolitan areas
should have exhibited the fastest rates of increase in both population
and education and thus 'pulled away' from smaller, less-education
metropolitan areas. The evidence largely supports this conclusion.","['human capital growth', 'economic growth', 'empirical studies', 'metropolitan areas', 'education stock', 'population growth', 'geographic distribution', 'education concentration', 'metropolitan disparities', 'education increase']","['economic activity', 'economic aid', 'economic behavior', 'economic conditions', 'economic development', 'economic expansion', 'economic growth', 'educational achievement', 'educational programs', 'employment projections']","human capital growth,empirical studies,education stock,education concentration,metropolitan disparities,education increase"

38578,"<p>In 2019, the National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE) team conducted a set of four integrated surveys of 1) households with children under age 13, 2) home-based providers, 3) center-based providers, and 4) the center-based workforce as a cross-sectional follow-up to the original 2012 NSECE. Together they characterize the supply of and demand for early care and education (ECE) in the U.S. and permit better understanding of how well families' needs and preferences mirror providers' offerings and constraints. The NSECE surveys make particular effort to measure the experiences of low-income families, as these families are the focus of a significant component of ECE and school-age public policy.</p>
<p>In light of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020, the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) funded a new data collection effort beginning in 2020 to learn how the pandemic was affecting ECE providers and the individuals who work directly with children in ECE settings. The NSECE project team sought to re-interview center-based providers, center-based workforce members, listed home-based providers, and unlisted and paid home-based providers, who completed surveys in the 2019 NSECE. Households participating in the 2019 NSECE were not included in the NSECE COVID-19 Longitudinal Follow-up. Data collection for the NSECE COVID-19 Longitudinal Follow-up took place across two waves between late 2020 and early 2022.</p>
<p>The NSECE was first conducted in 2012. Before that effort, there had been a 20-year long absence of nationally representative data on the use and availability of ECE. The NSECE was conducted again in 2019 to update the information from 2012 and shed light on how the ECE and school-age care landscape changed from 2012 to 2019. The 2019 NSECE followed a similar design as the 2012 survey, including surveying households with children under age 13, home-based providers, center-based providers, and staff working in center-based classrooms.</p>
<p>The 2019 NSECE is funded by the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The project team is led by NORC at the University of Chicago, with partners Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago and Child Trends, as well as other collaborating individuals and organizations.</p>

TEDS-A provides annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs that receive public funding. The unit of analysis is a treatment admission. TEDS consists of data reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs, which in turn report it to SAMHSA.</p>
<p>A sister data system, called the Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D), collects data on discharges from substance abuse treatment facilities. The first year of TEDS-A data is 1992, while the first year of TEDS-D is 2006.</p>
<p>TEDS variables that are required to be reported are called the ""Minimum Data Set (MDS)"", while those that are optional are called the ""Supplemental Data Set (SuDS)"".</p>
<p>Variables in the MDS include: information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, gender, race, ethnicity, education, employment status, substance(s) abused, route of administration, frequency of use, age at first use, and whether methadone was prescribed in treatment.

23022,"This poll, fielded March 7-11, 2007, is a part of a continuing series of
monthly surveys that solicits public opinion on the presidency and on a range of
other political and social issues.
This poll oversampled people who called themselves Republicans, providing an insight
into the demographic characteristics and political perspectives of Republicans.
All respondents were asked to say whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling
his job as president and other issues such as foreign policy, to rate the condition
of the national economy, to identify the most important problem facing the country,
and to say whether they approved of the way United States Congress was handling its job.
Several questions asked for respondents' opinions of the Democratic and Republican
parties, the Bush administration, Vice President Dick Cheney, former President Bill Clinton,
former Vice President Al Gore, and the 2008 presidential nominees.
Respondents were asked how much attention they had been paying to the
2008 presidential election campaign, which candidate they would vote for if the
election were being held that day, the ideal age of a president, and whether they thought
Hillary Clinton made a mistake when voting for the Senate resolution authorizing military action in Iraq.
Respondents who identified themselves as Republicans and Democrats were asked whether
they had any close friends who belonged to the other party, whether their political counterparts
shared the same goals and values, and whether they themselves had once belonged to the other party.
These respondents were also asked about the qualities they looked for in their presidential nominee,
which issues they felt most strongly about, and how often they visited
political blog Web sites, listened to political call-in radio shows, and which cable news network
they watched.
Other questions asked about the situation in Iraq, including whether taking
military action was the right thing to do, whether the number of troops should be
increased, and whether Iran was a threat to the United States.
Additional topics include respondents' opinions on the government, tax cuts,
immigration, gay marriage, abortion, and Barry Bonds breaking Hank Aaron's record of 775 home runs.
Demographic information includes sex, age, race, education level, household income,
marital status, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, type of
residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political
philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, and
the presence of children under 18 and household members between the ages of 18 and 24.","['public opinion', 'presidential approval', 'political demographics', 'party affiliation', 'election campaign', 'policy issues', 'social issues', 'media consumption', 'military action', 'demographic data']","['election campaigns', 'media consumption', 'military interventions', 'party affiliation', 'political attitudes and behavior', 'political campaigns', 'political parties', 'public opinion', 'social issues', 'voting behavior']","political demographics,election campaign,policy issues,media consumption,military action,demographic data"

 Vice President Al Gore, their state's governor, the United States
 Congress, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Texas governor George W. Bush,
 former Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole, former New Jersey Senator
 Bill Bradley, former Vice President Dan Quayle, Arizona Senator John
 McCain, former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, multimillionaire
 publisher Steve Forbes, and conservative commentator Pat
 Buchanan. Respondents were asked to assess the importance of a
 political candidate's stance on a variety of issues as well as which
 party is best able to handle those issues. Topics included crime, the
 economy, foreign affairs, the middle class, moral values, Medicare,
 the environment, partisanship, and tolerance. Those queried were asked
 whether they believed the 1994 switch of congressional balance to the
 Republican party had been a good or a bad thing. Given possible 2000
 presidential races between Democratic hopefuls Gore and Bradley and
 Republican hopefuls Bush and Dole, respondents were asked for whom
 they would vote. Those queried were also asked for whom they would
 vote in a Republican primary or caucus consisting of Bush, Dole,
 Quayle, Buchanan, Forbes, Alexander, McCain, Family Research Council
 president Gary Bauer, Ohio Congressman John Kasich, radio talk show
 host Alan Keyes, and New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith. They were also
 asked for whom they would vote in a Democratic primary or caucus
 consisting of Gore, Bradley, and Reverend Jesse Jackson. Respondents
 were asked whether the following characteristics made them more or
 less likely to vote for a candidate for president: the candidate is a
 woman, has used cocaine, has smoked marijuana, has never before held
 elected office, is an environmentalist, has cheated on a spouse, has
 lived and/or worked in Washington, DC, most of his/her life, has been
 accused of improper campaign fundraising, supports legalized abortion,
 was once a heavy drinker, and/or is supported by labor unions. A
 series of questions addressed the situation in Kosovo, including
 whether United States vital interests were at stake in the region,
 whether the United States should bomb Serbia if Serbia did not agree
 to a peace plan for Kosovo, and whether the United States and Europe
 should use ground forces to enforce a peace treaty. Additional topics
 covered the state of the nation's economy, possible uses for the
 federal budget surplus, respondent enthusiasm for a 2000 presidential
 race between Gore and Bush, and the 2000 congressional
 elections. Background information on respondents includes age, race,
 sex, education, religion, political party, political orientation,

3805,"<p>Initially taken in 1838 to demonstrate the stability and significance of
the African American community and to forestall the abrogation of African American voting rights, the Quaker and Abolitionist census of African Americans was continued in 1847 and 1856 and present an invaluable view of the mid-nineteenth century African American population of Philadelphia.  Although these censuses list only household heads, providing aggregate information for other household members, and exclude the substantial number of African Americans living in white households, they provide data not found in the federal population schedules.  When combined with the information on African Americans taken from the four federal censuses, they offer researchers a richly detailed view of Philadelphia's African American community spanning some forty years.</p>
<p>The three censuses are not of equal inclusiveness or quality, however. The 1838 and 1847 enumerations cover only the ""old"" City of Philadelphia (river-to-river and from Vine to South Streets) and the immediate surrounding districts (Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, Southwark, Moyamensing, Kensington--1838, West Philadelphia--1847); the 1856 survey includes African Americans living throughout the newly enlarged city which, as today, conforms to the boundaries of Philadelphia County.  In spite of this deficiency in areal coverage, the earlier censuses are superior historical documents.  The 1838 and 1847 censuses contain data on a wide range of social and demographic variables describing the household indicating address, household size, occupation, whether members were born in Pennsylvania, status-at-birth, debts, taxes, number of children attending school, names of beneficial societies and churches (1838), property brought to Philadelphia from other states (1838), sex composition (1847), age structure (1847), literacy (1847), size of rooms and number of people per room (1847), and miscellaneous remarks (1847).  While the 1856 census includes the household address and reports literacy, occupation, status-at-birth, and occasional passing remarks about individual households and their occupants, it excludes the other informational categories.  Moreover, unlike the other two surveys, it lists the occupations of only higher status African Americans, excluding unskilled and semiskilled designations, and records the status-at-birth of adults only.  Indeed, it even fails to provide data permitting the calculation of the size and age and sex structure of households.</p>
<p>Variables for each household head and his household include (differ
slightly by census year): name, sex, status-at-birth, occupation, wages,
real and personal property, literacy, education, religion, membership in
beneficial societies and temperance societies, taxes, rents, dwelling
size, address, slave or free birth.</p>","['african american census', 'philadelphia history', 'voting rights', 'abolitionist movement', 'demographic data', 'social variables', 'household analysis', 'mid-nineteenth century', 'racial demographics', 'census methodology']","['abolition movement', 'african americans', 'antebellum south (usa)', 'civil rights movement', 'demographic statistics', 'household composition', 'philadelphia history', 'racial demographics', 'slavery', 'voting rights act (1965-usa)']","african american census,philadelphia history,abolitionist movement,demographic data,social variables,household analysis,mid-nineteenth century,racial demographics,census methodology"

The study integrated neighborhood-level data on robbery and burglary gathered from local police agencies across the United States, foreclosure data from RealtyTrac (a real estate information company), and a wide variety of social, economic, and demographic control variables from multiple sources. Using census tracts to approximate neighborhoods, the study regressed 2009 neighborhood robbery and burglary rates on foreclosure rates measured for 2007-2008 (a period during which foreclosure spiked dramatically in the nation), while accounting for 2007 robbery and burglary rates and other control variables that captured differences in social, economic, and demographic context across American neighborhoods and cities for this period. The analysis was based on more than 7,200 census tracts in over 60 large cities spread across 29 states. Core research questions were addressed with a series of multivariate multilevel and single-level regression models that accounted for the skewed nature of neighborhood crime patterns and the well-documented spatial dependence of crime.

 schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development.
 One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which
 was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over
 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
 their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
 circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
 that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
 behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to
 gauge various aspects of human development, including individual
 differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One such
 measure was the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), a
 general test of intelligence, which David Wechsler, the test's author,
 defined as ""the global capacity of the individual to act purposefully,
 to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment."" In
 keeping with this definition of intelligence as an aggregate of mental
 aptitudes or abilities, the WAIS-R has traditionally consisted of 11
 subtests divided into two parts, verbal and performance. For this
 study, the WAIS-R included definitions of words only. It was only
administered to Cohort 12.","['human development', 'chicago neighborhoods', 'interdisciplinary study', 'longitudinal cohort', 'child development', 'adolescent development', 'antisocial behaviors', 'intelligence measurement', 'wais-r', 'cohort 12']","['adolescent development', 'antisocial behavior', 'child development', 'early childhood education', 'human development', 'intelligence measurement', 'longitudinal cohort', 'neighborhood conditions', 'public housing', 'youth development']","human development,chicago neighborhoods,interdisciplinary study,longitudinal cohort,adolescent development,antisocial behaviors,intelligence measurement,wais-r,cohort 12"

2560,"This study was undertaken to examine the compatibility of
 law enforcement agency accreditation and community policing. It sought
 to answer the following questions: (1) Are accreditation and community
 policing compatible? (2) Do accreditation and community policing
 conflict? (3) Does accreditation support community policing? (4) Did
 any of this change with the 1994 ""top-down"" revision of the
 Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA)
 standards? To that end, the researchers conducted separate content
 analyses of the 897 accreditation standards of the Commission on
 Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) in effect at the
 end of 1992 and the revised set of 436 standards published in
 1994. The standards were coded on 27 variables derived from the
 literature on community policing and police
 administration. Information was collected on the basics of each
 accreditation standard, its references to issues of community-oriented
 policing (COP) and problem-oriented policing (POP), and general
 information on its compatibility, or conflict with COP and POP. Basic
 variables cover standard, chapter, section, and
 applicability. Variables focusing on the compatibility of
 community-oriented policing and the accreditation standards include
 sources of legitimacy/authorization, community input, community
 reciprocity, geographic responsibility, and broadening of
 functions. Variables on problem-oriented policing include level of
 analysis, empirical analysis, collaboration with nonpolice agencies,
 evaluation/assessment, and nature of the problem. Variables on
 management and administration concern officer discretion,
 specialization by unit, specialization by task, formalization,
 centralization, levels/hierarchy, employee notification, employee
 involvement, employee rights, specific accountability, and customer
 orientation. General information on the compatibility or conflict
 between a standard and community-oriented policing/problem-oriented
 policing includes overall restrictiveness of the standard, primary
strategic affiliation, focus on process, and focus on administration.","['law enforcement accreditation', 'community policing compatibility', 'calea standards revision', 'content analysis methodology', 'community-oriented policing', 'problem-oriented policing', 'police administration variables', 'inter-agency collaboration', 'empirical evaluation', 'strategic policing focus']","['community policing', 'empirical research', 'interagency cooperation', 'law enforcement', 'police administration', 'police community relations', 'police effectiveness', 'police training', 'problem solving', 'strategic planning']","law enforcement accreditation,community policing compatibility,calea standards revision,content analysis methodology,community-oriented policing,police administration variables,inter-agency collaboration,empirical evaluation,strategic policing focus"
2162,"The Record of American Democracy (ROAD) data provide
election returns, socioeconomic summaries, and demographic details
about the American public at unusually low levels of geographic
aggregation. The NSF-supported ROAD project spans every state in the
country from 1984 through 1990 (including some off-year
elections). These data enable research on topics such as electoral
behavior, the political characteristics of local community context,
electoral geography, the role of minority groups in elections and
legislative redistricting, split ticket voting and divided government,
and elections under federalism. One set of files (Part 3, PRECINCT
directory, consisting of 205 SPSS portable files) includes every
election at and above state House, along with party registration and
other variables, in each state for the roughly 170,000 precincts
nationwide (about 60 times the number of counties). Another set of
files (Part 4, MCDGRP directory, 52 SPSS portable files) has added to
these roughly 30-40 political variables an additional 3,725 variables
merged from the 1990 United States Census for 47,327 aggregate units
called MCD groups. The MCD group is a construct for purposes of this
data collection. It is based on a merging of the electoral precincts
and Census Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs). A MCD is about the size of a
city or town. A MCD group is smaller than or equal to a county and
(except in California) is greater than or equal to the size of a
MCD. The MCD group units completely tile the United States
landmass. The program used to create the MCD group level is also
included as part of this collection, as well as the input and output
files. This collection also includes geographic boundary files (found
in the BOUNDS directory, Part 2) so users can easily draw maps with

National and Local Profiles of Cultural Support collected data on public and private support for professional nonprofit arts and cultural organizations in three ways: a national mail survey of a random sample of arts organizations on their sources of revenue, more detailed mail surveys of the identified universe of arts and cultural organizations in ten specific communities, and in-person and telephone interviews with local government officials regarding public agency support (both financial and in-kind) in these ten communities. The ten communities are as follows: Amery, Wisconsin; Cleveland, Ohio; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Montgomery County, Maryland; Nashville, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Jose, California. A collaborative effort of Americans for the Arts and the Arts Policy and Administration Program at The Ohio State University, the study was supported by The Pew Charitable Trusts and local arts agencies in ten communities across the country.
</p>
<p>
The National Survey collected data from professional nonprofit arts and cultural organizations on 22 revenue items for fiscal year 1998, across four categories--public contributed income, private contributed income, earned revenue, and interest and other investment income. Developed in close collaboration with the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), the survey was designed to facilitate comparisons with currently available data on the nonprofit arts, particularly data sets from arts service organizations and NCCS data sets based on IRS Form 990 data. The Local Government Support Survey involved semi-structured interviews with local officials in non-arts government agencies across 13 service areas in the ten communities profiled in this study. Among the agencies represented in these service areas were Administrative Services, Community Planning/Economic Development, Convention and Visitors Bureau, Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Police/Public Safety, and others. Two sets of interview forms were used, one to document the agency's mission and level of current and future arts involvement and a case form to document specific instances of arts support. Further, the Local Surveys, conducted in each of ten communities, collected data from professional nonprofit arts and cultural organizations on a battery of revenue items for fiscal year 1998, across four categories-public contributed income, private contributed income, earned revenue, and interest and other investment income. Developed in close collaboration with the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), the surveys were designed to facilitate comparisons with currently available data on the nonprofit arts, particularly data sets from arts service organizations and NCCS data sets based on IRS Form 990 data.

4123,"This special topic poll, conducted September 23-26, 2004,
is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public
opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social
issues. Respondents were asked to give their opinions of United States
President George W. Bush, how he has handled his presidency, how he
compares to Democratic presidential candidate Senator John F. Kerry on
trustworthiness, leadership abilities, honesty, and other qualities,
and the state of the economy at the time of the survey. In addition
to Bush and Kerry, Ralph Nader (Independent) was a candidate for
president and the candidates for vice-president were incumbent
Vice-President Dick Cheney (Republican), Senator John Edwards
(Democrat), and Peter Camejo (Independent). Respondents were further
asked for whom they would vote if the election were held in September,
how closely they were following the election, whether they were a
strong supporter of either candidate, which candidate was better
qualified to be commander-in-chief of the United States armed
services, to rate the likelihood they would vote in the November 2004
presidential election, what two issues were most important in choosing
the president, and what one personal quality was most important for
the president to possess. Further questions addressed respondents'
satisfaction with the direction the country was heading in, the
long-term effects of military action in Iraq on United States
security, the degree of success the United States was achieving in
Iraq, and the economic and human costs of military action in
Iraq. Additional questions concerned whether respondents were better
off financially in September 2004 than before September 11, 2001,

22683,"In November 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a change in the way it communicates its view of the economic outlook: It increased the frequency of its forecasts from two to four times per year, and it increased the length of the forecasting horizon from two to three years. The FOMC does not release the individual members' forecasts or standard measures of consensus such as the mean or median. Rather, it continues to release the forecast information as a range of forecasts, both the full range between the high and the low and a central tendency that omits the extreme values. This paper uses individual forecaster data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) to mimic the FOMC's method for creating their central tendency. The authors show that the midpoint of the central tendency of the SPF is a reliable measure of the consensus, suggesting that the FOMC reporting method is also a reliable measure of consensus. For the dates when both are available, the authors also compare the relative forecast accuracy of the FOMC and SPF consensus forecasts for output growth and inflation. Overall, the differences in forecast accuracy are too small to be statistically significant.","['fomc communication', 'economic outlook', 'forecast frequency', 'forecasting horizon', 'consensus measures', 'range of forecasts', 'central tendency', 'survey of professional forecasters', 'forecast accuracy', 'statistical significance']","['economic behavior', 'economic conditions', 'economic forecasting', 'economic growth', 'economic indicators', 'economic policy', 'economic trends', 'forecasting models', 'monetary policy', 'public opinion']","fomc communication,economic outlook,forecast frequency,forecasting horizon,consensus measures,range of forecasts,central tendency,survey of professional forecasters,forecast accuracy,statistical significance"

9786,"In this follow-up to the National Health Interview Survey 
 (NHIS), teenagers were interviewed to obtain information on tobacco 
 use, including measures of prevalence, knowledge and attitudes, and 
 predictors of taking up smoking. Respondents were asked if they smoked 
 or used chewing tobacco or snuff, or had in the past. If so, they were 
 questioned as to when they started, how much they smoked, chewed, or 
 snuffed during the last month, where they bought cigarettes, which 
 brand of cigarettes, chewing tobacco, or snuff they usually bought, how 
 many times they tried to stop these habits, and what was the longest 
 time they stopped smoking cigarettes since they started smoking 
 regularly. Nonsmokers were asked if they thought they might start 
 smoking, if they had experimented with cigarette smoking, if they had 
 ever been offered a cigarette, and how difficult it would be to obtain 
 tobacco if they wanted to. The survey asked respondents if any of their 
 household members, teachers, or friends smoked, if they had heard 
 anything about the health risks of tobacco use on television, radio, or 
 in newspapers or magazines, and if they believed that chewing tobacco 
 or using snuff causes cancer. Attitudes toward tobacco use were also 
 probed with questions such as whether respondents disliked being around 
 people who smoked, whether they believed it was safe to smoke for only 
 a year or two, if they preferred to date people who didn't smoke, if 
 they thought they could stop smoking any time they wanted to, whether 
 they thought their friends approved or disapproved of their smoking, 
 chewing, or snuffing, and if they thought their parents would mind if 
 they smoked when they were older. Respondents were also asked if they 
 believed there was any harm in having an occasional cigarette, and if 
 they believed smoking helps people to relax, to keep down their weight, 
 and to reduce boredom and stress. In addition to questions about 
 tobacco use, the survey queried respondents about their attitudes 
 regarding seat belts, fitness, alcohol, marijuana, drugs in general, 
 school, and diet. They were also asked whether, during the last year, 
 they had been in an accident or physical fight, had been in a car with

affective style, and to characterize the peripheral consequences of these
central profiles for biological systems that may be relevant to health. The
primary aims were to: (1) characterize individual differences in emotional
reactivity, recovery, and sustaining processes using corrugator and zygomatic
electromyography and eyeblink startle magnitude, (2) characterize individual
differences in brain morphology and connectivity using structural magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) (3) characterize
individual differences in functional activity within the neural circuitry of
emotion using task and resting state fMRI, (4) calculate brain age, and (5)
test the ability of these indices to predict the comprehensive array of health,
wellbeing, cognitive, psychological, social, and life challenge factors
assessed in other MIDUS projects. To probe individual differences in emotional
processes, psychophysiological and fMRI measures of emotional responses to the
presentation of negative, positive, and neutral pictures, and these same
measures during a post-picture period were examined.</p>
<p> Emotion-influenced memory
was assessed at both the psychophysiological and imaging sessions: (1) Free
recall of the presented affective pictures at the end of the
psychophysiological session. (2) Memory and likeability ratings for neutral

20622,"The purpose of this study was to examine the crime of identity theft from the offenders' perspectives. The study employed a purposive sampling strategy. Researchers identified potential interview subjects by examining newspapers (using Lexis-Nexis), legal documents (using Lexis-Nexis and Westlaw), and United States Attorneys' Web sites for individuals charged with, indicted, and/or sentenced to prison for identity theft. Once this list was generated, researchers used the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Inmate Locator to determine if the individuals were currently housed in federal facilities. Researchers visited the facilities that housed the largest number of inmates on the list in each of the six regions in the United States as defined by the BOP (Western, North Central, South Central, North Eastern, Mid-Atlantic, and South Eastern) and solicited the inmates housed in these prisons. A total of 14 correctional facilities were visited and 65 individuals incarcerated for identity theft or identity theft related crimes were interviewed between March 2006 and February 2007. Researchers used semi-structured interviews to explore the offenders' decision-making processes. When possible, interviews were audio recorded and then transcribed verbatim. Part 1 (Quantitative Data) includes the demographic variables age, race, gender, number of children, highest level of education, and socioeconomic class while growing up. Other variables include prior arrests or convictions and offense type, prior drug use and if drug use contributed to identity theft, if employment facilitated identity theft, if they went to trial or plead to charges, and sentence length. Part 2 (Qualitative Data), includes demographic questions such as family situation while growing up, highest level of education, marital status, number of children, and employment status while committing identity theft crimes. Subjects were asked about prior criminal activity and drug use. Questions specific to identity theft include the age at which the person became involved  in identity theft, how many identities he or she had stolen, if they had worked with other people to steal identities, why they had become involved in identity theft, the skills necessary to steal identities, and the perceived risks involved in identity theft.","['identity theft', 'offender perspectives', 'purposive sampling', 'interview methodology', 'federal prison', 'semi-structured interviews', 'quantitative data', 'qualitative data', 'decision-making processes', 'criminal behavior']","['antisocial behavior', 'criminal behavior', 'decision-making processes', 'identity theft', 'interview methodology', 'offender profiles', 'prison inmates', 'qualitative data', 'quantitative data', 'semi-structured interviews']","offender perspectives,purposive sampling,interview methodology,federal prison,semi-structured interviews,quantitative data,qualitative data,decision-making processes,criminal behavior"

on the United States population compiled from ICPSR holdings of
county-level census materials and enhanced with information obtained
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the United States
Department of Commerce. County-level socioeconomic indicators were
aggregated and reported for 171 functional urban regions encompassing
the entire contiguous United States. These regions, established in the
early 1960s by BEA, comprise whole counties surrounding a central
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area node that served as a recipient
location of work commuting or a center of newspaper circulation,
wholesale trade, or banking transactions. Total population counts,
proportions of adults, males, African-Americans, and foreign-born,
measures of population change, number of persons per household, and
per capita values of manufactured and farm products are listed for
census years between 1820-1970. For some years, data on per capita
income were obtained from BEA publications. The study also includes
derived measures computed by the principal investigators, such as
logarithmic values of population totals, Z-scores of most of the basic

standard Eurobarometer measures, such as how satisfied they were with
their present life, whether they attempted to persuade others close to
them to share their views on subjects they held strong opinions about,
whether they discussed political matters, and what the European
Union's priorities should be. Additional questions focused on the
respondents' knowledge of and opinions about the European Union (EU),
including sources of information about the EU and whether their
country had benefited from being an EU member. Respondents were asked
questions concerning citizenship and their overall feeling of
belonging, such as what was most important to them: family,
friendship, work, the arts/culture, politics, health, or money.
Respondents were asked how important the following values were to
them: rule of law, respect for human life, human rights, individual
freedom, democracy, tolerance, peace, or solidarity. Respondents were
asked if they agreed that the State intervened too much in their
lives, criminals needed help and understanding, immigrants were a
threat to their way of life, economic growth must be a priority even
if it affects the environment, and that free competition was the best
guarantee for economic prosperity. Respondents were also asked if
they'd be willing to learn one or more foreign language and what would
be the motivation for doing so (i.e., to use on holidays abroad, to
get a better job, to be able to understand people from other cultures,
or for personal satisfaction), if they'd be interested or involved in
the sports, arts and culture, music, and lifestyles of other countries
in the EU and in countries outside of the EU, toward which country
they felt the greatest affinity, whether the United States and the EU
played a positive or negative role regarding peace in the world,
fighting terrorism, growth of the world's economy, the fight against
poverty in the world, and the protection of the environment.
Additional questions focused on fraud and whether respondents had read
or seen anything about fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, or
counterfeiting of goods in their country, in other countries of the
EU, in the countries which are candidates to join the EU, or elsewhere
in the world. Respondents were asked what type of fraud worried them
the most (e.g., hacking, pirating software, illegal data trading,
counterfeiting of goods, commercial fraud like cheating on prices,
weights, and goods, customs fraud, VAT fraud, or misappropriation of
aids and grants), how well the media informed those in the EU about
various types of fraud in the other countries of the EU as well as in
their respective country, and whether using the police force, customs
services, taxation authority, courts, private auditing firms, or the
media was the most effective way to fight the EU and its budget from
being defrauded. Respondents were also asked questions regarding the
European Parliament, specifically how many European Parliament
elections they voted in and if they were going to vote in the next
one, how much impact the European Parliament had on their everyday
lives, and whether the European Parliament election campaign should
mainly focus on agriculture, environment, employment, immigration,
education, foreign policy, enlargement of the EU, or the rights of the
EU citizen. Those queried were also asked if they were interested in
knowing more about the European Parliament whether via the television,
radio, Internet, or newspapers. Background information includes
gender, age, marital status, level of education, current occupation,
household income, who contributed most to the household income,

Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the European Union (EU), including how well informed they felt about the EU, what sources of information about the EU they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EU member, and the extent of their personal interest in EU matters. The survey also elicited respondents' opinions about the European Parliament and other EU institutions. Those queried were asked how many European Parliament elections they voted in and if they were going to vote in the next one, how much impact the European Parliament had on their everyday lives, whether the European Parliament protected their interests, and which areas it should concentrate on in order to defend respondents' interests. Another set of questions, which focused on public safety, asked whether respondents felt safe in their neighborhoods, whether over the last year they had been attacked or seriously threatened and if so whether they reported it to the police, how often they personally encountered drug-related problems in their neighborhoods, whether somebody had ever broken into or tried to break into their homes, and if so, whether they subsequently took any protective measures. The survey also queried respondents about defense policy issues. Respondents were asked about the role of a European army, whether the EU should have a common defense and security policy, who should make decisions concerning defense in Europe, how this decision should be made within the EU, whether the European army should replace national armies, and what they thought about the EU swift intervention force of 60,000 men. Another focus of the survey was EU enlargement. Respondents were asked about measures that should be taken by the EU before enlargement, potential effects of this process, whether they were for or against enlargement, fears connected with building the EU, what countries they would be in favor of or against becoming new members, what criteria were important in deciding whether a country should join the EU, and whether after enlargement the EU decisions should be made unanimously or by majority. Additional questions queried respondents about the euro, the EU's budget spending, priorities for the EU initiatives, areas in which decisions should be made by national governments and jointly with the EU, a common foreign policy toward countries outside the EU, national versus pan-European pride, satisfaction with democracy, expectations for 2001, and level of trust in different institutions. Respondents were also asked how often they watched news on TV, read news in daily papers, and listened to the news on the radio.

drug use, criminal violence, and domestic violence in a parolee
population. More specifically, the data explore the contributions of
parental substance abuse and domestic violence in prediction of parolee
violence. The study also investigates the effects of drug and alcohol
use on domestic violence for the parolee, the spouse, and the parents.
The data were drawn from individual interviews conducted with parolees
from the Buffalo, New York, area, half of whom were convicted of
violent crimes and half of whom were convicted of nonviolent crimes.
Interviews were also conducted with the spouses and partners of the
parolees. In addition, data concerning the parolees' criminal histories
were abstracted from arrest and parole records. Part 1, Demographic
File 1, provides information on the demographic characteristics of
offenders, arrests, convictions, and sentencing, institutional
transfers, disciplinary reports, indications of psychiatric diagnosis
or psychological disturbances, alcohol and drug use, criminal activity,
and substance abuse while incarcerated. Part 2, Demographic File 2,
includes the same variables as Part 1 (with the exception of
information about psychiatric diagnoses, psychological disturbances,
and disciplinary reports) for those individuals who declined to be
interviewed and a random sample of those who could not be contacted.
Part 3, the Interview File, contains information about childhood social
histories (including sociodemographics, experience of family violence
as a victim and as a witness, and parental drug and alcohol use),
self-reported criminal histories, adult social histories (including
data concerning violence in current relationships, and drug and alcohol
use history), and information about the parolees' and spouses'

9476,"This project was undertaken to investigate organized 
 criminal groups and the types of business activities in which they 
 engage. The focus (unit of analysis) was on the organized groups rather 
 than their individual members. The project assessed the needs of these 
 groups in pursuing their goals and considered the operations used to 
 implement or carry out their activities. The data collected address 
 some of the following issues: (1) Are business operations (including 
 daily operations, acquiring ownership, and structuring the 
 organization) of organized criminal groups conducted in a manner 
 paralleling legitimate business ventures? (2) Should investigating and 
 prosecuting white-collar crime be a central way of proceeding against 
 organized criminal groups? (3) What are the characteristics of the 
 illegal activities of organized criminal groups? (4) In what ways are 
 legal activities used by organized criminal groups to pursue income 
 from illegal activities? (5) What is the purpose of involvement in 
 legal activities for organized criminal groups? (6) What services are 
 used by organized criminal groups to implement their activities? 
 Variables include information on the offense actually charged against 
 the criminal organization in the indictments or complaints, other 
 illegal activities participated in by the organization, and the 
 judgments against the organization requested by law enforcement 
 agencies. These judgments fall into several categories: monetary relief 
 (such as payment of costs of investigation and recovery of stolen or 
 misappropriated funds), equitable relief (such as placing the business 
 in receivership or establishment of a victim fund), restraints on 
 actions (such as prohibiting participation in labor union activities or 
 further criminal involvement), and forfeitures (such as forfeiting 
 assets in pension funds or bank accounts). Other variables include the 
 organization's participation in business-type activities--both illegal 
 and legal, the organization's purpose for providing legal goods and 
 services, the objectives of the organization, the market for the 
 illegal goods and services provided by the organization, the 
 organization's assets, the business services it requires, how it 
 financially provides for its members, the methods it uses to acquire 
ownership, indicators of its ownership, and the nature of its victims.","['organized crime', 'business operations', 'white-collar prosecution', 'illegal activities', 'legal fronts', 'economic purpose', 'law enforcement strategies', 'asset forfeiture', 'market analysis', 'ownership acquisition']","['asset forfeiture', 'business operations', 'economic sanctions', 'illegal activities', 'international law', 'law enforcement strategies', 'market analysis', 'organized crime', 'white-collar prosecution', 'ownership acquisition']","business operations,white-collar prosecution,legal fronts,economic purpose,law enforcement strategies,market analysis,ownership acquisition"

4013,"This poll, conducted February 2004, is part of a series of
monthly polls that solicit public opinion on political and social
issues. Views were sought on President George W. Bush and his handling
of the presidency, the economy, and foreign affairs, as well as the
2004 presidential campaign and the situation with Iraq. A series of
questions addressed whether President Bush shared the same priorities
as the respondent, whether he became a war president because of world
events or the choices he made, and whether he brought different groups
of Americans together or divided them. Respondents were asked about
the condition of the national economy, whether the country was going
in the right or wrong direction, and the effect of the Bush
administration's policies on taxes and jobs. Several questions asked
whether the result of the war with Iraq was worth the human and
economic costs, whether it was a part of or separate from the war on
terrorism, whether the United States made the correct decision in
taking military action against Iraq, and whether it made the United
States safer or less safe from terrorism. Opinions were solicited on
whether the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq existed,
whether it mattered if they were found, whether the Bush
administration told the entire truth about the existence of these
weapons, and how well the Bush administration and United States
intelligence agencies assessed the threat of weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq prior to the war. Respondents were also polled on
how much attention they paid to the 2004 presidential campaign,
whether they planned to vote for President Bush or a Democratic
candidate, whether their mind was made up yet, the issue they most
wanted candidates to discuss, whether they planned to vote in a
Republican and Democratic primary or caucus, and whether the current
system of primaries and caucuses produced the best presidential
candidates. Questions regarding the Democratic presidential nomination
addressed who the party should nominate, the main reason respondents
would like to see that person nominated, whether respondents had ever
supported nominee Howard Dean, their impressions of nominee John
Kerry, and their level of satisfaction if Kerry won the nomination.
Respondents also gave their opinions of the Republican and Democratic
parties, how important it was for a president to have served in the
military, and whether a candidate's personal character and values or
position on issues was more important in their vote. Background
variables include age, sex, religion, religiosity, education,
ethnicity, household income, marital status, number of telephone lines
in household, political party affiliation, political orientation, and

practices in science, in research, and in experimental development,
this study provided for a multi-faceted evaluation of scientific
productivity and effectiveness at the levels of both the individual
scientist and the research unit. The survey was conducted by six

standardized questionnaires, translated into the national languages of
the participating countries, to a sample of scientists drawn from nine
major fields of science and technology and representing approximately
200 research institutions in each of six countries: Austria, Belgium,
Finland, Hungary, Poland, and Sweden. The questionnaires were
administered respectively to the head of the research unit, to the
administrative officer, to staff scientists, to technical support
staff, and to external evaluators. This data collection is an
aggregated file of the five respondent levels, using the research unit
as the case for analysis. In all, there are 1,222 research units in
the sample. The questionnaires incorporated a wide variety of
indicators for socio-psychological and sociological factors such as
satisfaction with the work environment, ratings of supervisory
qualities, perceptions of influence patterns, and the latitude in the
choice of research themes. Additionally, the collection includes

32508,"This poll, fielded September 23-27, 2010, is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social issues. This poll surveyed approximately 1,114 Ohio residents. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way Barack Obama was handling his job as president, the economy, job creation, whether they thought things in the country were going in the right direction, their rating of the national economy and the economy in Ohio, and what they thought was the most important problem facing Ohio. Respondents were also asked whether they approved of the way Congress was handling its job, how Republicans and Democrats in Congress were handling their jobs,  how then Governor Ted Strickland was handling his job, how much attention they paid to the 2010 election campaigns in Ohio, the likelihood they would vote in the 2010 election in November,  and for whom they would vote if the elections for United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, and Governor of Ohio were being held that day. Opinions were sought on Rob Portman, Lee Fisher, John Kasich, Ted Strickland, Nancy Pelosi, and John Boehner. Information was collected on whether respondents thought the recession was temporary and whether Ohio would ever fully recover, who they thought was most to blame for the state of the national economy, and who they preferred, Democrats or Republicans, kept control of the House of Representatives. Respondents were asked about whether they were contacted on behalf of any Senate or gubernatorial candidates, whether they approved of the health care law that was enacted the previous March, whether Congress should have repealed it, whether the stimulus package made Ohio's economy better, whether the stimulus package created new jobs in Ohio, whether they expect the job market in their area to improve, and whether the financial assistance given to the auto and banking industry made Ohio's economy better. Additional topics covered included personal finances, job security, and how the recession affected the respondents and their families. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, education level, household income, military service, religious preference, reported social class, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), perceived social class, political party affiliation, political philosophy,  voter registration status, and whether respondents thought of themselves as born-again Christians.","['public opinion', 'presidential approval', 'economic assessment', 'political affiliation', 'voting intentions', 'congressional approval', 'healthcare legislation', 'economic recovery', 'stimulus impact', 'demographic information']","['economic attitudes', 'health care reform', 'political affiliation', 'political attitudes and behavior', 'political campaigns', 'public opinion', 'voting behavior', 'voting patterns', 'voting preference', 'voting turnout']","economic assessment,voting intentions,congressional approval,healthcare legislation,stimulus impact,demographic information"
4402,"Social surveys were the starting point for research in Nang Rong, a district in the Buriram province of northeast Thailand. The surveys were part of three waves of data collection conducted in 1984, 1994, and 2000. The baseline was established in 1984 when a community survey and a household census were conducted in 51 study villages. The census obtained information on all members of all households within the study area. A second round of surveys was fielded a decade after the baseline, in 1994, building on and extending the original research design and focus. The 1994 data were collected through a community survey administered in all villages in Nang Rong (including but not limited to the original 51 study villages), a household survey providing a complete census of all households in each of the original 51 study villages, and a migrant follow-up survey. The migrant follow-up survey collected data on out-migrants from 22 of the original 51 study villages who had relocated to one of four urban destinations: (1) metropolitan Bangkok, (2) the eastern seaboard, a focus of rapid growth and development, (3) Korat, a regional city, and (4) Buriram, the provincial capital. The 2000 round of data collection again built on the previous data collection efforts and included a community survey administered in all villages in Nang Rong district, a household survey and complete census of the original 51 study villages, a migrant follow-up survey that tracked out-migrants from 22 villages to the four urban destinations as well as to rural villages within Nang Rong district. In addition, this round also included a geospatial component with the collection of locational data for dwelling units and agricultural plots.","['social surveys', 'nang rong', 'buriram province', 'data collection', 'household census', 'community survey', 'migrant follow-up', 'urban destinations', 'geospatial component', 'agricultural plots']","['agricultural census', 'community development', 'data collection', 'household composition', 'internal migration', 'migrant labor', 'population census', 'rural migration', 'survey methodology', 'urban population']","social surveys,nang rong,buriram province,data collection,household census,community survey,migrant follow-up,urban destinations,geospatial component,agricultural plots"

34737,"The Tahoe Regional Household Travel Survey, 2005, is a comprehensive survey of the travel patterns of households in the Tahoe basin region of California and Nevada. The survey was conducted for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) over a four-month period, from June through September 2005. This collection contains 2 sets of travel data: (1) a survey of 1,220 permanent households within the Tahoe basin region, and (2) a subset survey of 125 seasonal households within the same area. The permanent resident dataset contains information about 2,732 household members, 2,471 vehicles, and details regarding 11,048 trips made during a 24-hour period; the seasonal resident subset features 726 trip observations and information about 229 household members and 185 vehicles. The survey relied on the willingness of study area residents to (1) provide demographic information about the household, its members, and its vehicles, and (2) document all travel for each household member, regardless of age, over an assigned 24-hour period. During the recruitment phase, respondents were asked to provide detailed household information, including permanent or seasonal resident status, number of household occupants, type of dwelling unit, number of vehicles available to household members, as well as the year, body type, and fuel type of each vehicle. Survey participants received mailed travel logs to aid in  documenting travel information for the 24-hour assessment period.

35247,"This study involved a purposive sample of 129 Vietnamese immigrant women to the United States, 57 of whom experienced domestic violence. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected on abuse, efforts to stop the abuse, immigration experiences, current and prior relationship with partners, and many facets of life. One year after the first interview, the women who had experienced abuse were re-interviewed to determine whether their circumstances had changed and why they had or had not changed. For both interviews, data were collected on contacts with the justice system and satisfaction with those contacts. To measure abuse and one-year outcomes, variables included: values/norms promoting husband's domination, conflict over expectations about gender roles and other aspects of family life, immigration (reasons for immigration, sequencing of husband's and wife's move, each person's legal status), and circumstances related to immigration (discrimination, employment and occupational status, proximity of extended family, wife's support network). Qualitative data on the pattern, nature, and context of the abuse was collected to provide description of why the abuse occurred, and to support findings from the quantitative analysis and/or better specify the causative model. Additional variables included wife's perceptions of immigration law and the outcome of criminal justice involvement; wife's perception of the consequences of divorce (financial, legal realities and cultural norms regarding child custody, effect of marital status on woman's social status and quality of life); need for and effects of wife moving from the ethnic community to the mainstream to escape abuse (need of identification with the ethnic group, support network of relatives and friends, social reactions to abuse); wife's economic power (ability to speak English, earn a living); wife's experience in seeking help (knowledge of United States legal system, availability of legal and victim assistance for abused women, experience with the justice system and victim assistance programs).

3088,"The Alcohol and Drug Services Study (ADSS) was a national
study of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients. The study
was designed to develop estimates of the duration and costs of
treatment and to describe the post-treatment status of substance abuse
clients. ADSS continues and extends upon data collected in the Drug
Services Research Survey, 1990: [United States] (ICPSR 3393) and the
Services Research Outcome Study, 1995-1996: [United States] (ICPSR
2691) with a more complete sampling frame, an enhanced sampling
design, and more detailed measures of treatment services provided, the
costs of treatment, and clients in treatment. ADSS was implemented in
three phases. In Phase I, a nationally representative sample of
treatment facilities was surveyed to assess characteristics of
treatment services and clients including treatment type, costs,
program capacity, the number of clients served, waiting lists, and
services provided to special populations. In Phase II, records were
abstracted from a sample of clients in a subsample of Phase I
facilities. This phase included four sub-components: (1) the Main
Study, an analysis of abstracted records to assess the treatment
process and characteristics of discharged clients, (2) the Incentive
Study, which assessed the impact of varying financial payments on
follow-up interview participation among non-methadone outpatient
clients, (3) the In-Treatment Methadone Client study (ITMC), which
assessed the treatment process of methadone maintenance, and (4) the
comparison study of Early Dropout clients (EDO), which provided a
proxy comparison group of records from substance abusers that went
untreated. Phase III involved follow-up personal interviews with Phase
II clients who could be located. This interview sought to determine
post-treatment status in terms of substance use, economic condition,
criminal justice involvement, and further substance abuse treatment
episodes. Urine testing was conducted to validate self-reported drug
use. Drugs included in the survey were alcohol, marijuana, cocaine,
crack cocaine, heroin, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines,
non-prescribed use of prescription medications, abuse of
over-the-counter medications, and other drugs. ADSS also included a
cost study, which involved obtaining additional financial information
from the Phase II facilities. A computerized desktop audit was used in
the cost study to conduct consistency and accuracy checks on selected
questionnaire data from Phases I and II. Variables were subsequently
updated to represent the most accurate data available. Additional
analysis variables were then created using combinations of the revised
Phase I and II data.","['substance abuse treatment', 'national study', 'treatment facilities', 'treatment costs', 'post-treatment status', 'sampling design', 'client characteristics', 'methadone maintenance', 'follow-up interviews', 'cost analysis']","['drug abuse', 'drug courts', 'drug dependence', 'drug education', 'drug law offenses', 'drug offenders', 'drug testing', 'drug treatment', 'drug use', 'substance abuse treatment']","national study,post-treatment status,sampling design,follow-up interviews"

3271,"By 1996 it became apparent that the Los Angeles county
 jails faced a serious overcrowding problem. Two possible solutions to
 the problem were to build more jail capacity or to divert a greater
 number of incoming inmates to community-based, intermediate
 sanctions. The research team for this study was asked to review a 1996
 profile of inmates in the Los Angeles jail system and to determine how
 many of them might have been good candidates for intermediate
 sanctions such as electronic monitoring, work release, house arrest,
 and intensive supervision. The researchers selected a sample of 1,000
 pre-adjudicated (or unconvicted) inmates from the total census of
 inmates in jail custody on January 15, 1996, to study in more detail.
 Of the 1,000 offenders, the researchers were able to obtain jail and
 recidivism data for two years for 931 inmates. For each of these
 offenders, information on their prior criminal history, current
 offense, and subsequent recidivism behavior was obtained from official
 records maintained by several county agencies, including pretrial
 services, sheriff's department, probation, and courts. Demographic
 variables include date of birth, race, and gender. Prior criminal
 history variables for each prior adult arrest include type of filing
 charge, case disposition, type of sentence and sentence length
 imposed, and total number of prior juvenile petitions sustained.
 Current offense variables include arrest date, crime type for current
 arrest, crime charge, type and date of final case disposition, and
 sentence type and length, if convicted. Strike information collected
 includes number of strikes and the offense that qualified as a
 strike. Jail custody variables include the jail entry and exit data
 for the current offense and the reason for release, if released.

4045,"A separate Criminal Domestic Violence Court (CDVC) was
established in Lexington County, South Carolina, in November 1999, to
hold perpetrators of domestic violence accountable through increasing
fines and jail time and to place a strong emphasis on mandatory
batterer treatment programs. The CDVC was a specialized court that
combined the efforts of law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, mental
health professionals, and victim advocates to improve the safety of
domestic violence victims and hold offenders accountable. The
researchers undertook to evaluate and measure the extent to which the
CDVC was successful in implementing its goals. For the process
evaluation, interviews were conducted in 2002 with 50 victims and 50
defendants to examine their overall level of satisfaction with the
court process, their perceptions of procedural justice, and their
recommendations for improving the CDVC process. Interviews were
conducted in person using structured questions immediately after a
case was heard. The outcome evaluation consisted of two methods of
data collection. A time series intervention analysis examined the
monthly frequency of criminal domestic violence for the years 1997
through 2001. Criminal domestic violence cases were compared for the
34 months before the establishment of the CDVC (January 1997 to
October 1999) and the first 26 months following its implementation
(November 1999 to December 2001). Additionally, in an effort to
examine the impact of the Lexington County Criminal Domestic Violence
Court on individual case outcomes, a recidivism analysis was conducted
on a random sample of 400 criminal domestic violence cases. Of these
cases, 200 were control cases drawn from the Lexington County
Sheriff's Department's arrest database for the period January 1997 to
June 1999, and 200 were treatment cases comprised of domestic violence
arrest cases that occurred between December 1999 and December 2000 and
processed through CDVC. Variables in Part 1 (Victim Interview Data)
and Part 2 (Defendant Interview Data) included responses to structured
interview questions about the victims' and offenders' perceptions of
various aspects of the court process, whether they felt treated with
dignity and respect, and their overall impression of the CDVC response
to domestic violence. Variables in Part 3 (Monthly Arrest Data)
include court period, month, and frequency of monthly domestic
violence arrests, monthly simple assault arrests, and monthly
aggravated assault arrests. Variables in Part 4 (Recidivism Data)
include race, age, and gender of offender, employment status, booking
date, days in jail prior to trial, number of charges pending, number
of prior domestic violence offenses, date of first re-arrest,

The original goal for the project was to obtain completed surveys from at least 3,500 randomly sampled households in the region. Respondents were asked to complete a travel log to document their trips, activities, transportation methods, and travel time for a 24-hour period. Demographic variables include number of vehicles per household, number of occupants per household, type of household structure, whether respondents held a driver's license, annual household income, whether respondents had a physical disability, employment status, age, gender, and race of respondents.","['regional travel study', 'transportation planning', 'household survey', 'travel demand modeling', 'louisville area', 'cross-state analysis', 'demographic variables', 'travel behavior', 'data collection', 'survey methodology']","['data collection', 'demographic variables', 'household survey', 'public transportation', 'survey methodology', 'transportation planning', 'travel behavior', 'travel demand modeling', 'urban planning', 'urban populations']","regional travel study,transportation planning,household survey,travel demand modeling,louisville area,cross-state analysis,demographic variables,travel behavior,data collection"

34347,"The 2003 Santarem dataset consists of 8 interconnected datasets and 1 linking file. The primary unit of analysis is the rural property or lot. Each lot in the sample contains a minimum of 1 household with a mean of 1.33 households per lot in the final sample. Within households, data were collected on subsets of individuals as well as additional properties used by the households in the study. These 2003 Santarem data come from interviews with farm families in an agricultural zone south of the city of Santarem in the Brazilian state of Para. Santarem is a relatively old settlement within the Brazilian Amazon that has experienced waves of regional settlement in the 1930s, mid-century, and the 1970s. The study region is adjacent to the confluence of the Amazon and Tapajos Rivers and the northern terminus of the BR-163 (the Cuiaba-Santarem Highway). BR-163 links intensive agropastoral production (particularly mechanized soybean farming) in the state of Mato Grosso to Santarem, where the multinational corporation Cargill runs a deepwater port (opened in 2003) for loading soybeans onto oceangoing ships. The opening of this port has accelerated the process of urbanization and led to a transformation from a landscape of small family farming to a landscape of mechanized agriculture (description adapted from VanWey, Leah K., and Kara B. Cebulko, 2007, Journal of Marriage and the Family 69: 1257-1270). The discourse on deforestation has focused on the alarming rates of deforestation in the Amazon Basin to the neglect of the dynamic and reciprocal influences between the human population and the environment. Deforestation is a process mediated by human intervention, from the act of clearing to how such a clearing is used and managed over time. It would be helpful to know whether observable rates of forest removal represent a stage in the developmental cycle of households or represents the simple and direct impact of increasing population in these environments. From the point of view of theory and method, it is necessary to develop new approaches that effectively link demographic process to the interactive relationship of population to specific aspects of an environmental matrix. This project addressed multiple scales, from household dynamics to landscape dynamics and has developed methods by which to scale between them.  We hypothesize that as households occupy frontier areas past the first generation, they move from a strategy of managing their land under the constraints of available household labor to a strategy that gives greater recognition of the constraints posed by land quality and of the risks to their farm operation coming from external socioeconomic forces and biophysical constraints. In the first generation, the labor available to a household is determined by the size of the household making the initial trip to the frontier (primarily young couples is common in frontier regions) and later by the fertility of these initial migrants. As these initial migrants age and their children enter adulthood (thereby becoming the second generation), labor supply is determined by the reproductive and land use choices of these children. Given the precipitous decline in female fertility, other factors gain salience in the second generation: the suitability of the land for various uses, the availability of off-farm employment and educational opportunities (both locally and those requiring migration), and macroeconomic factors affecting the economic viability of farming. These decisions then directly determine the entries into and exits from the household. This study investigated five basic questions:  (1) Does the changing availability of household labor over the household life cycle affect the trajectory of deforestation and land use change in the same way for later generations of Amazonian farmers as for first generation in-migrants?  (2) What are the determinants of changing household labor supply? Specifically, what are the biophysical and socioeconomic determinants of entries into and exits from the household through fertility, migration, and marriage?  (3) How are the decisions of households regarding land use and labor allocation constrained by soil quality, access to water supplies, interannual drought events (e.g. El Nino type events), and other resource scarcities? (4) Are there notable differences in land use choices made by landholders who live in an urban area (away from the piece of land owned in the rural area) in contrast to the decisions made by those who live on their rural properties? (5) What are the bases for the precipitous decline in female fertility in these frontier regions, especially the use of sterilization after two pregnancies? Households will be surveyed in the Santarem region, in the Lower Tapajos Basin, Brazilian Amazon to collect detailed demographic, land-use histories, and economic data. The sampling of households for inclusion in the study will be based on a stratified random sample by period of occupation in Santarem, to capture intergenerational processes that preceded the availability of satellite images.  Based on the particular combination of methodologies used in this investigation (traditional household surveys, satellite image analysis, and GIS, and the scaling up and down from households to landscape), future environmental changes were projected for the regional landscape under various scenarios of continued settlement, household life cycles, combinations of credit, and changing environmental conditions.","['amazonian deforestation', 'household dynamics', 'land use change', 'labor supply determinants', 'fertility trends', 'rural-urban migration', 'socioeconomic forces', 'biophysical constraints', 'environmental matrix', 'methodological combination']","['environmental degradation', 'environmental impact', 'environmental planning', 'environmental policy', 'environmental protection', 'fertility rates', 'international migration', 'land use', 'rural population', 'urban planning']","amazonian deforestation,household dynamics,land use change,labor supply determinants,fertility trends,rural-urban migration,socioeconomic forces,biophysical constraints,environmental matrix,methodological combination"

<p>The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides federal money to States and Territories to provide assistance to low-income families receiving or in transition from temporary public assistance, to obtain quality child care so they can work, attend training, or receive education. Within the broad federal parameters, states and territories set the detailed policies. Those details determine whether a particular family will or will not be eligible for subsidies, how much the family will have to pay for the care, how families apply for and retain subsidies, the maximum amounts that child care providers will be reimbursed, and the administrative procedures that providers must follow. Thus, while CCDF is a single program from the perspective of federal law, it is in practice a different program in every state and territory.</p>
<p>The CCDF Policies Database project is a comprehensive, up-to-date database of inter-related sources of CCDF policy information that support the needs of a variety of audiences through (1) Analytic Data Files and (2) a Book of Tables. These are made available to researchers, administrators, and policymakers with the goal of addressing important questions concerning the effects of alternative child care subsidy policies and practices on the children and families served, specifically parental employment and self-sufficiency, the availability and quality of care, and children's development. A description of the Data Files and Book of Tables is provided below:</p>
<p>1. Detailed, longitudinal Analytic <hi>Data Files</hi> of CCDF policy information for all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and United States Territories that capture the policies actually in effect at a point in time, rather than proposals or legislation. They focus on the policies in place at the start of each fiscal year, but also capture changes during that fiscal year. The data are organized into 32 categories with each category of variables separated into its own dataset. The categories span five general areas of policy including:</p><list type=""bulleted"">
<itm>Eligibility Requirements for Families and Children (Datasets 1-5)</itm>
<itm>Family Application, Terms of Authorization, and Redetermination (Datasets 6-13)</itm>
<itm>Family Payments (Datasets 14-18)</itm>
<itm>Policies for Providers, Including Maximum Reimbursement Rates (Datasets 19-27)</itm>
<itm>Overall Administrative and Quality Information Plans (Datasets 28-32)</itm></list>
<p>The information in the Data Files is based primarily on the documents that caseworkers use as they work with families and providers (often termed ""caseworker manuals""). The caseworker manuals generally provide much more detailed information on eligibility, family payments, and provider-related policies than the documents submitted by states and territories to the federal government. The caseworker manuals also provide ongoing detail for periods in between submission dates.</p>
<p>Each dataset contains a series of variables designed to capture the intricacies of the rules covered in the category. The variables include a mix of categorical, numeric, and text variables. Every variable has a corresponding notes field to capture additional details related to that particular variable. In addition, each category has an additional notes field to capture any information regarding the rules that is not already outlined in the category's variables.</p>
<p>2. The <hi>Book of Tables</hi> is available as seven datasets (Datasets 33-39) and they present key aspects of the differences in CCDF funded programs across all states and territories as of October 1, 2015. The Book of Tables includes variables that are calculated using several variables from the Data Files (Datasets 1-32). The Book of Tables summarizes a subset of the information available in the Data Files, and includes information about eligibility requirements for families; application, redetermination, priority, and waiting list policies; family co-payments; provider policies and reimbursement rates; and select administration and quality development information. In many cases, a variable in the Book of Tables will correspond to a single variable in the Data File. Usually, the variable options used in the Book of Tables will match the variable options in the Data File. In some cases, the wording of the variable options may have been slightly modified for the tables.</p>
<p>The Data Files provide a more detailed set of information than what the Book of Tables provide, including a wider selection of variables and policies over time. The Data Files capture the intricacies of the rules covered in the category for each state and time frame. Each variable in any given dataset has a corresponding notes field to capture additional details related to that particular variable.</p>","['ccdf policies', 'federal funding', 'child care assistance', 'state variability', 'policy analysis', 'data files', 'eligibility requirements', 'provider reimbursement', 'administrative procedures', 'quality of care']","['child care', 'early childhood education', 'eligibility requirements', 'federal assistance', 'federal funds', 'policy analysis', 'public policy', 'quality of care', 'state government', 'welfare services']","ccdf policies,federal funding,child care assistance,state variability,data files,eligibility requirements,provider reimbursement,administrative procedures,quality of care"
4482,"This poll, fielded October 7-9, 1996, is part of a
 continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public opinion on
 the presidency and on a range of other political and social issues.
 The survey solicited public opinion prior to and immediately following
 the vice-presidential debate held October 9, 1996. Respondents were
 asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his
 handling of the presidency and issues such as foreign policy. Several
 questions asked how much respondents had been paying attention to the
 presidential campaign, whether they were likely to vote in the
 election for president, which candidate they would vote for if the
 presidential elections were being held that day, whether they had
 favorable opinions of the candidates, and who they expected to win.
 Opinions were collected on the condition of the national economy, how
 taxes would be affected based on which candidate was voted president,
 whether respondents preferred the federal budget deficit to be reduced
 or taxes to be cut, and whether the government could reduce the
 deficit and cut taxes at the same time. Respondents were asked whether
 they watched Sunday's debate between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, which
 candidate did the best job or won, whether they learned anything new
 about the candidates, and how likely it was that they would watch the
 October 9 vice-presidential debate. The call-back poll, conducted on
 October 9, 1996, concerned respondents' reactions about the debate
 between Al Gore and Jack Kemp. Views were sought on whether
 respondents watched the debate, which candidate did the best job or
 won, whether the candidates addressed issues that mattered, whether
 respondents had changed their minds about their choice for vice
 president, and for whom they would vote had the elections been held
 that day. Demographic variables include sex, race, age, household
 income, education level, political party affiliation, political
 philosophy, voter participation history and registration status,
 whether respondents had any children starting ninth grade, length of
 time living at current residence, and type of residential area (e.g.,
urban or rural).","['public opinion', 'presidential campaign', 'vice-presidential debate', 'bill clinton', 'bob dole', 'al gore', 'jack kemp', 'national economy', 'voter demographics', 'policy issues']","['campaign expenditures', 'election campaigns', 'national economy', 'political campaigns', 'presidential campaigns', 'presidential elections', 'public opinion', 'voter turnout', 'voting behavior', 'voting patterns']","presidential campaign,vice-presidential debate,bill clinton,bob dole,al gore,jack kemp,voter demographics,policy issues"
36621,"<p>The Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) program of research was initiated in response to the 1977 report of the President's Commission on Mental Health. The purpose was to collect data on the prevalence and incidence of mental disorders and on the use of and need for services by the mentally ill. Independent research teams at five universities (Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Washington University, Duke University, and University of California at Los Angeles), in collaboration with the National Institute for Mental Health, conducted the studies with a core of common questions and sample characteristics. The sites were areas that had previously been designated as Community Mental Health Center catchment areas: New Haven, Connecticut, Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Durham, North Carolina, and Los Angeles, California. Each site sampled over 3,000 community residents and 500 residents of institutions, yielding 20,861 respondents overall. The longitudinal ECA design incorporated two waves of personal interviews administered one year apart and a brief telephone interview in between (for the household sample). The diagnostic interview used in the ECA was the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), Version III (with the exception of the Yale Wave I survey, which used Version II). Diagnoses were categorized according to the DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, 3rd Edition (DSM-III). Diagnoses derived from the DIS include manic episode, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, single episode major depression, recurrent major depression, atypical bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, schizophrenia, schizophreniform, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobia, somatization, panic, antisocial personality, and anorexia nervosa. The DIS uses the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which measures cognitive functioning, as an indirect measure of the DSM-III Organic Mental Disorders. In the ECA survey, this diagnosis is called cognitive impairment.</p>

33221,"<p>The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED) visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.</p>
<p>DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.</p>
<p>The DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity.

 Rockville, Maryland, this survey is the fourth edition of the Survey
 of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA), with prior SPPA surveys
 having been conducted in 1982, 1985, and 1992. Respondents were asked
 about their past-year participation in, and frequency of attending,
 art performances and events in the following categories: jazz music,
 classical music, opera, musicals, plays (nonmusical), ballet, other
 dance, art museums, arts fairs, and historical parks. Participation
 was tabulated for: (1) live arts events attendance, such as visiting
 an art museum, (2) participation in arts through broadcast and records
 media, such as using a personal computer (PC) to listen to/see art,
 and (3) personal performance or creation of art, such as composing
 music. Reasons for nonparticipation were also collected. Survey
 questions also asked about socialization in the arts, as well as about
 respondents' rates of participation in leisure activities other than
 the arts. New questions in the 1997 SPPA concerned, for example,
 respondents' use of a home computer in the creation of and interaction
 with art. New questions also asked about subscribing to series of
 performances and about membership at art museums. Due to the
 considerable differences in survey methodologies, this 1997 survey

35233,"<p>Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and
causes of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States
hospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the
NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).</p> <p>The NEISS-AIP is designed to
provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes
of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital
EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national
sample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a
stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and
its territories with a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour ED. The
sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and
small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per
hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond
routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related
products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and
poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and
distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor
unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)
identify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for
follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and
(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion
effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in
a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique
and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,
annually, the final edited data are released as public use data files
for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).</p>
<p>NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.</p>
<p>Since the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/"">Internet publications</a> will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.</p>","['injury surveillance', 'neiss-aip', 'data collection', 'hospital eds', 'consumer safety', 'injury prevention', 'public health', 'federal agencies', 'surveillance data', 'injury estimates']","['consumer safety', 'data collection', 'federal agencies', 'hospitalization', 'injury prevention', 'public health', 'public health services', 'surveillance', 'victim services', 'violence prevention']","injury surveillance,neiss-aip,data collection,hospital eds,consumer safety,injury prevention,federal agencies,surveillance data,injury estimates"

29441,"<p>The 2001 Detroit Area Study (DAS) is a survey of over 4,300 adults in metro Detroit and addresses their perceptions, expectations, satisfaction, and behaviors associated with community living. The 2001 DAS, conducted in the spring and summer 2001, consisted of two parts. Initially, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a probability sample of 315 adult respondents (18 years of age and older) living in the tri-county area of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb Counties. Subsequently, a questionnaire was mailed to a sample of adults throughout the seven counties; 4,077 were returned. Response rates were 59.8 percent for the face-to-face sample and 56.7 percent for the mail sample. In addition to survey responses, DAS 2001 compiled contextual information about the minor civil divisions (MCDs) or communities and environments associated with each respondent. Contextual information includes housing and demographic characteristics, land use characteristics, and other characteristics of the communities where respondents live (growth rates, employment, school information). Questions on the survey asked about residential history; public services and transportation; government and taxes; schools; police; parks, recreation and where kids play; shopping and other community issues; community participation and involvement; neighborhood and neighboring; housing and prospective mobility; safety; employment and journey to work; health and health care facilities; other Detroit and regional issues; demographics; and observations.
The 2001 DAS presents a unique opportunity to explore and record changes over time by measuring people's opinions and behaviors and the conditions in their communities.
The 2001 DAS is different from earlier DAS surveys in several ways. First, the study has been expanded from three to seven counties in southeast Michigan, often referred to as the metro Detroit area. That is, the study contacted residents in Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Wayne, and Washtenaw counties and in the city of Detroit. Second, the number of people contacted is greatly increased using a combination of face-to-face interviews and questionnaires sent by mail. Over 4,000 households in the region were contacted. Third, the questionnaires were designed in consultation with stakeholder groups representing government, industry, and nonprofit organizations in the region. Finally, indicators associated with the sampled households are being compiled and analyzed (along with the survey responses) using statistical and spatial analytic techniques including Geographic Information Systems (GIS).</p>","['detroit area study', 'community perceptions', 'satisfaction measurement', 'behavioral analysis', 'metro detroit', 'survey expansion', 'face-to-face interviews', 'mailed questionnaires', 'stakeholder consultation', 'gis analysis']","['area studies', 'community development', 'community involvement', 'community participation', 'community policing', 'community service programs', 'public opinion', 'satisfaction', 'survey methodology', 'surveys']","detroit area study,community perceptions,satisfaction measurement,behavioral analysis,metro detroit,survey expansion,face-to-face interviews,mailed questionnaires,stakeholder consultation,gis analysis"

 attitudes and expectations, to understand why these changes occur, and 
 to evaluate how they relate to consumer decisions to save, borrow, or 
 make discretionary purchases. This type of information is essential for 
 forecasting changes in aggregate consumer behavior. Since the late 
 1940s, these surveys have been produced quarterly through 1977 and 
 monthly thereafter. Each monthly survey contains approximately 40-50 
 questions and probes a different aspect of consumer confidence. 
 Open-ended questions are asked concerning evaluations and expectations 
 about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national 
 business situation. Additional questions probe buying intentions for 
 automobiles and the respondent's appraisals of present market

38440,"This study aimed to document how existing sexuality education policies and curricula are implemented in schools in developing countries through case studies of 4 countries. These data come from ten of twelve surveys: principals, teachers and students in Ghana and Kenya, and teachers and principals in Guatemala and Peru. In each country, three regions were purposively selected to represent geographic, ethnic and cultural diversity. In each region, the research team selected a representative sample of secondary schools, for a total of 60-80 schools in each country. The surveys of principals and teachers were interviewer-administered, and elicited detailed information on the content, approach and format of teaching sexuality education in each of the sampled schools, assessment methods, teacher training, and opinions on successes and failures of the program. The survey of students was self-administered at school with detailed guidance from fieldworkers. It assessed students' knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding sexuality and reproductive health, obtained opinions on strengths and weaknesses in the curriculum and teaching, and asked for their preferences regarding content, teaching approach, format and timing of the sexuality education program.","['sexuality education policies', 'developing countries', 'case studies', 'school implementation', 'curriculum assessment', 'teacher training', 'student knowledge', 'reproductive health', 'cultural diversity', 'teaching approaches']","['curriculum evaluation', 'educational policy', 'health education', 'reproductive health', 'school health', 'sex education', 'teacher training', 'teaching methods', 'teaching qualifications', 'teenage pregnancy']","sexuality education policies,developing countries,case studies,school implementation,curriculum assessment,student knowledge,teaching approaches"

26583,"Using Random Digit Dial, this study tested the feasibility of using a brief telephone interview to assess sexual attraction, behavior, and identity among women.  A neighborhood in Boston with a high density of lesbian residents was selected. The study used three criteria to identify a neighborhood that was expected to have a high density of lesbian residents. Neighborhoods were defined by a postal ZIP code so that potential respondents could easily identify whether or not they lived in the target area. The criteria used were: (a) a high proportion of never-married females aged 35 years or older (calculated as ratio of ZIP code area to city wide, United States Department of Commerce, 1990), (b) a high proportion of female-headed households who also reported an unmarried female
partner in the household (United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1990), and (c) a high proportion of female patients from the ZIP code area among Fenway Community Health Center female patients (Fenway Community Health Center is a major health service provider to gay and lesbian populations in Boston and Cambridge). These  criteria led to the selection of the Jamaica Plain neighborhood in Boston. Women were eligible if they resided in that area,
were between the ages of 18 and 59 years, and spoke English well enough to be able to answer the interview questions. Phone interviews lasted a mean of 5.6 minutes. Respondents who identified themselves as lesbian or bisexual completed
an additional specialized section that lasted a mean of 2.5 minutes and inquired about participation in and identification with the gay/lesbian community. In total, 1,250 numbers were dialed. Of them, 169 (14 percent) were
nonworking numbers, 165 (13 percent) were not households (e.g., businesses), 235 (19 percent) were indeterminable (number was never answered by a person), and 681 (54 percent) were households. Of these households, 439 (64 percent) were successfully
screened, 176 (26 percent) refused or delayed screening, and 66 (10 percent) could not be screened (e.g., language barriers). Of the screened households, 223 (51 percent) were not eligible.

being in the top one percent of the population. Their development was
followed over the next sixty years via questionnaires, personal
interviews, and various test instruments. Questions were asked about
their health, physical and emotional development, school histories,
recreational activities, home life, family background, educational,
vocational, and marital histories. Questions were also asked about
income, emotional stability, and socio-political attitudes. The
follow-up questionnaires were concerned with the evolution of the

Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the presidency and the economy, the most important problem facing the nation, and how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign. Several questions addressed the economy and sought opinions on the condition of the national economy, the most important economic problem facing the nation, whether the United States was in an economic recession and whether the economy was getting better or worse. Registered voters were asked whether they were more likely to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus, which candidate they supported and why, who they expected to win the Democratic nomination, their opinions of the candidates, and for whom they would vote if the election was held that day. Views were also sought on Senator Barack Obama's former minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright's statements and whether his statements affected the respondent's opinions of Obama. Respondents were asked how concerned they were about several aspects of their personal finances including being able to afford health care, housing, and retirement costs, college tuition, and whether they were concerned about their job security. Respondents were also asked about their biggest economic concern, whether they were getting ahead financially, whether they had made cutbacks in their spending, and whether rises in food prices was affecting them.

Also considered were competing explanations for the same evidence, especially interpretations based on period and recency effects. The data come from nine surveys, mostly national, carried out in the United States and in six other countries (China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Lithuania, and Russia), between 1985 and 2010. The hypothesis is largely supported for recall of past events, and also for commemorative behavior connected to World War II and to the Vietnam War. The evidence is mixed with regard to attitudes toward the Gulf War and the Iraq invasion, emphasizing the distinction between generational effects that result from lifetime experience and those due to a critical period. The analysis considered most of the major events faced by Americans over the past 80 years, ranging from the Great Depression to current issues, including such national traumas as the assassination of President Kennedy, the Vietnam War, and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.

7538,"This data collection contains information gathered about
pretrial release policies, procedures, and outcomes in a 1969 survey
of police chiefs, judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and bail
project directors in 72 cities across the United States (with a higher
proportion in Illinois). The research objectives included: (1)
developing a model designed to determine the optimum percentage of
defendants to hold prior to trial, (2) developing a model designed to
make decisions on whether a defendant should be released or held in
jail prior to trial, (3) comparing cities having bail reform projects
with cities not having them, (4) comparing cities that required arrested
persons to provide 10 percent of the bond with cities requiring 100
percent of the bond, and (5) determining the causes and effects of
variations across cities in the percentage of defendants held in jail
prior to trial. The survey focused on the processing of arrested
persons prior to trial. Respondents answered questions about the
organization and procedures in pretrial release, supplied
approximate statistical data (e.g., percent of arraigned individuals
who were released prior to their trial and failed to appear in court
for their trial), estimated statistical trends in pretrial release
during the previous five years, reported on attitudes in their
communities toward administration of bail, rated the importance of
several criteria when determining if a defendant was to be allowed
pretrial release, and indicated whether their city had a bail reform
program, and if so, its characteristics. Demographic data (ranging
from population to income to crime rates) about the 72 cities

 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
 their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
 circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
 that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
 behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to gauge
 various aspects of human development, including individual
 differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One such
 measure was the subject version of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

 15, and 18. The instrument was adapted from the Anxiety module of the
 Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC 4) and obtained
 information regarding any anxiety or stress the subjects may have
 experienced in the past year in relation to traumatic events that may
 have happened to them. It is closely related to PROJECT ON HUMAN

 toward democracy, markets, and civil society in several sub-Saharan
 African nations, and to track the evolution of such attitudes in those
 nations over time. This particular survey was concerned with the
 attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Namibia. Respondents were
 asked to rate Namibia's President Nujoma and his administration's
 overall performance, and to state the most important issues facing the
 nation. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in
 improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and
 national government, whether government officials were responsive to
 problems of the general population, and whether local government
 officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice
 system, the media, the Independent National Electoral Commission, and
 the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were
 polled on their knowledge of government officials, their level of
 personal involvement in political, governmental, and community
 affairs, and the inclusiveness of the government. Economic questions
 addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the
 respondent's economic condition, and whether great income disparities
 are fair. Societal questions addressed whether everyone should be
 responsible for themselves and their own success or failure, what
 characteristics respondents used to identify themselves, whether it
 was easy to obtain assistance with securing food, water, schooling,

34563,"<p>Nearly 9 million Americans live in extreme-poverty neighborhoods, places that also tend to be racially segregated and dangerous. Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups:</p>
<p>1.	The low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location.</p>
<p>2.	The traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling.</p>
<p>3.	The control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled.</p>
<p>Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of ""neighborhood"" on participating families. These particular files include data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation and are comprised of variables analyzed for the article ""Neighborhood Effects on the Long-Term Well-Being of Low-Income Adults"" that was published in the journal Science on September 21, 2012. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood leads to long-term (10- to 15-year) improvements in adult physical and mental health and subjective well-being,  despite not affecting economic self-sufficiency. Subjective well-being is more strongly affected by changes in neighborhood economic disadvantage than racial segregation, which is important because racial segregation has been declining since 1970, but income segregation has been increasing. The files submitted here contain all outcomes and mediators analyzed for the article as well as a variety of demographic and other baseline measures that were controlled for in the analysis.</p>","['moving to opportunity', 'extreme-poverty neighborhoods', 'randomized housing experiment', 'low-income families', 'neighborhood effects', 'long-term well-being', 'physical and mental health', 'economic self-sufficiency', 'subjective well-being', 'income segregation']","['affordable housing', 'economic assistance', 'housing discrimination', 'income distribution', 'low income groups', 'neighborhood characteristics', 'neighborhood conditions', 'poverty programs', 'public housing', 'urban poverty']","moving to opportunity,extreme-poverty neighborhoods,randomized housing experiment,low-income families,neighborhood effects,long-term well-being,physical and mental health,economic self-sufficiency,subjective well-being,income segregation"
9887,"This poll is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys
that evaluate the Bush presidency and solicit opinions on a variety of
political and social issues. Respondents were asked to identify the
most important problem facing the country, to indicate whether they
approved or disapproved of Bush's handling of the presidency in general
and of his handling of foreign affairs and the economy in particular,
and to offer opinions on whether Bush was able to deal with the big
issues that faced the country. Those surveyed were also asked if they
approved of the way their own United States Representative was handling
his or her job, and whether they approved of the way Congress was doing
its job. Concerning economic matters, respondents were asked how the
money from potential cuts in military spending should be used, whether
they were better off financially than in 1989 when Bush became
president, and whether Bush or the Democrats in Congress could be
trusted to do a better job on the economy. Concerning political
parties, respondents were asked whether the Democrats or Republicans
better represented the interests of various groups of people, and
whether the Democrats or Republicans could do a better job of coping
with the main problems the nation would face in the coming years.
Focusing on health care, respondents were asked whether they trusted
Bush or the Democrats in Congress to do a better job of improving the
health care system in this country, whether they could vote for a
candidate whose position on health care was different from theirs, and
if a candidate's position on health care was the most important issue
to consider in deciding whether to support that candidate. With respect
to Bush's 1992 State of the Union address, those surveyed were asked if
they approved of most of the proposals made in the speech, how much
Bush's economic proposals would help the economy and the respondent's
own financial situation, and whether Bush would be able to accomplish
most of the goals he outlined in his speech. Concerning the Persian
Gulf War, the survey asked respondents whether the war had been worth
fighting considering its cost to the United States versus its benefit,
and whether the respondent was more likely to support Bush for a second
term as a result of the Gulf War. Regarding the issue of extramarital
affairs involving a presidential candidate, respondents were asked if
they could vote for a candidate who had had an affair, whether the
allegation that Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton had had
an affair would have an effect on their vote, and if that should be an
issue in the presidential election. Respondents were also asked whether
Clinton should withdraw from the race if it turned out that he did have
an affair with Gennifer Flowers, whether his withdrawal should be based
on having had an affair or having denied it, and whether Clinton or
Flowers had told the truth. Concerning the 1992 presidential election,
respondents were asked for whom they would vote if their state held a
Democratic or Republican primary/caucus for president, toward whom they
were leaning at the time of the interview, whether they would vote for
Bush or various other prospective candidates/nominees if the national
election were held at the time of the interview, and toward whom they
were leaning at the time of the interview. Those surveyed were also
asked their views concerning presidential primaries and caucuses, and
about their expectations for the 1992 presidential campaign. Additional
campaign questions asked respondents if who is elected in 1992 really
made any difference, and whether they thought that they were being
referred to when Republican and Democratic candidates for political
office talked about the middle class. Other questions dealt with the
respondent's impression of various candidates involved in the 1992
presidential election, the reelection of the respondent's
representative in Congress, and the chances of the respondent's voting
in the 1992 presidential election. Background information on
respondents includes political alignment, voter registration status,
most recent presidential vote choice, education, age, race, income,
economic class, religion, marital status, household composition, labor
union membership, urban/suburban/rural residence, and sex.","['bush presidency', 'public opinion', 'economic policy', 'health care', '1992 election', 'persian gulf war', 'political parties', 'bill clinton', 'voter sentiment', 'campaign issues']","['bush administration (1989-1993)', 'bush', 'george h.w.', 'clinton administration (1993-2001)', 'clinton', 'bill', 'economic policy', 'health care', 'persian gulf war', 'political parties', 'presidential elections', 'public opinion']","bush presidency,1992 election,bill clinton,voter sentiment"

37100,"<p>Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) expanded the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and causes of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States hospitals with emergency departments (EDs). This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).</p>
<p>The NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).</p>
<p>NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.
NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.</p>
<p>Since the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury
Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.
In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/"">Internet publications</a> will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.</p>","['injury surveillance', 'neiss-aip', 'nonfatal injuries', 'emergency departments', 'data collection', 'consumer safety', 'injury prevention', 'public health', 'federal collaboration', 'injury monitoring']","['ambulatory care', 'consumer protection', 'emergency services', 'federal collaboration', 'injury prevention', 'public health', 'public health services', 'public safety', 'surveillance', 'violence prevention']","injury surveillance,neiss-aip,data collection,consumer safety,injury prevention,federal collaboration,injury monitoring"

37356,"<p>The Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS) is part of the larger ""Program of Research on the Causes and Correlates of Delinquency"" initiated by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in 1986. PYS aims to document the development of antisocial and delinquent behavior from childhood to early adulthood, the risk factors that impinge on that development, and help seeking and service provision of boys' behavior problems. The study also focuses on boys' development of alcohol and drug use, and internalizing problems.</p>
<p>PYS consists of three samples of boys who were in the first, fourth, and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools during the 1987-1988 academic year (called the youngest, middle, and oldest sample, respectively). Using a screening risk score that measured each boy's antisocial behavior, boys identified at the top 30 percent within each grade sample on the screening risk measure (n=~250), as well as an equal number of boys randomly selected from the remainder (n=~250), were selected for follow-up. Consequently, the final sample for the study consisted of 1,517 total students selected for follow-up. 506 of these students were in the oldest sample, 508 were in the middle sample, and 503 were in the youngest sample.</p>
<p>Assessments were conducted semiannually and then annually using multiple informants (i.e., boys, parents, teachers) between 1987 and 2010. The youngest sample was assessed from ages 6-19 and again at ages 25 and 28. The middle sample was assessed from ages 9-13 and again at age 23. The oldest sample was assessed from ages 13-25, with an additional assessment at age 35. Information has been collected on a broad range of risk and protective factors across multiple domains (e.g., individual, family, peer, school, neighborhood).  Measures of conduct problems, substance use/abuse, criminal behavior, mental health problems have been collected.</p>

relationship between discipline and the control of victimization in
schools and to investigate the effectiveness of humanistic versus
coercive disciplinary measures. Survey data were obtained from students, teachers,
and principals in each of the 44 junior and senior high schools in a
county in Ohio that agreed to participate in the study. The data
represent roughly a six-month time frame. Students in grades 7 through
12 were anonymously surveyed in February 1994. The Student Survey (Part 1)
was randomly distributed to approximately half of the students in all
classrooms in each school. The other half of the students received a
different survey that focused on drug use among students (not
available with this collection). The teacher (Part 2) and principal
(Part 3) surveys were completed at the same time as the student
survey. The principal survey included both closed-ended and open-ended
questions, while all questions on the student and teacher surveys were
closed-ended, with a finite set of answers from which to choose. The
three questionnaires were designed to gather respondent demographics,
perceptions about school discipline and control, information about
weapons and gangs in the school, and perceptions about school crime,
including personal victimization and responses to victimization. All
three surveys asked whether the school had a student court and, if so,
what sanctions could be imposed by the student court for various forms
of student misconduct. The student survey and teacher surveys also
asked about the availability at school of various controlled
drugs. The student survey elicited information about the student's
fear of crime in the school and on the way to and from school,
avoidance behaviors, and possession of weapons for protection. Data
were also obtained from the principals on each school's
suspension/expulsion rate, the number and type of security guards
and/or devices used within the school, and other school safety
measures. In addition to the surveys, census data were acquired for a
one-quarter-mile radius around each participating school's campus,
providing population demographics, educational attainment, employment
status, marital status, income levels, and area housing
information. Also, arrest statistics for six separate crimes (personal
crime, property crime, simple assault, disorderly conduct,
drug/alcohol offenses, and weapons offenses) for the reporting
district in which each school was located were obtained from local police
departments. Finally, the quality of the immediate neighborhood was
assessed by means of a ""windshield"" survey in which the researchers
conducted a visual inventory of various neighborhood characteristics:
type and quality of housing in the area, types of businesses, presence
of graffiti and gang graffiti, number of abandoned cars, and the
number and perceived age of pedestrians and people loitering in the
area.

2259,"The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is a
part of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), administered by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the late 1970s, the law
enforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the
UCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR
program to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI
fully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet
contemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a
comprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a
""Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program"" was
developed. Using the ""Blueprint"" and in consultation with local and
state law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines
for the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting
System (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS
data are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be
merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of
aspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers
data on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is
delineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are
Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias
motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property
description, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim
Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender
Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest
date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts
1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by
Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which
is contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,
geographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B
Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B
crimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for
which the complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the
FBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the
incident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the
incident occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As
with UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law
enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of
crime in the United States. For 1995, 9 states, fully or partially
participating in NIBRS, were included in the dataset.","['nibrs implementation', 'crime reporting', 'fbi program', 'law enforcement', 'data archiving', 'icpsr files', 'crime incident', 'agency identification', 'voluntary participation', 'non-representative data']","['criminal justice policy', 'criminal justice programs', 'criminal justice system', 'criminal law', 'criminal offenses', 'criminal prosecution', 'criminal records', 'criminality prediction', 'law enforcement agencies', 'law enforcement officers']","nibrs implementation,fbi program,data archiving,icpsr files,crime incident,agency identification,voluntary participation,non-representative data"

The supplement, on the topic of public participation in the arts in the United States, was sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
<p>The CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population aged 15 years old or older living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. The basic CPS data are provided on labor force activity for the week prior to the survey. In addition, CPS provides respondents' demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and industry.</p>
<p>The ABS captures data on American's participation in the arts through personal performance and creation. Examples include the share of adults who: play a musical instrument; perform or practice singing, dance, or acting; take photographs for artistic purposes; and engage in textile arts such as knitting, crocheting, or embroidery. Questions were also asked about the use of pottery, ceramics, jewelry, leatherwork, metalwork and woodwork.

4566,"The National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted,
Runaway, and Thrownaway Children (NISMART) were undertaken in response
to the mandate of the 1984 Missing Children's Assistance Act
(Pub.L. 98-473) that requires the Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to conduct periodic national incidence
studies to determine the actual number of children reported missing
and the number of missing children who are recovered for a given
year. The first such study, NISMART-1 (NATIONAL INCIDENCE STUDIES OF
MISSING, ABDUCTED, RUNAWAY, AND THROWNAWAY CHILDREN (NISMART), 1988
[ICPSR 9682]), was conducted from 1988 to 1989 and addressed this
mandate by defining major types of missing child episodes and
estimating the number of children who experienced missing child
episodes of each type in 1988. At that time, the lack of a
standardized definition of a ""missing child"" made it impossible to
provide a single estimate of missing children. As a result, one of the
primary goals of NISMART-2 was to develop a standardized definition
and provide unified estimates of the number of missing children in the
United States. Both NISMART-1 and NISMART-2 comprise several component
datasets designed to provide a comprehensive picture of the population
of children who experienced qualifying episodes, with each component
focusing on a different aspect of the missing child population. The
Household Survey -- Youth Data and the Household Survey -- Adult Data
(Parts 1-2) are similar but separate surveys, one administered to the
adult primary caretaker of the children in the sampled household and
the other to a randomly selected household youth aged 10 through 18 at
the time of interview. The Juvenile Facilities Data on Runaways (Part
3) sought to estimate the number of runaways from juvenile residential
facilities in order to supplement the household survey estimate of the
number of runaways from households. And the Law Enforcement Study
Data, by case perpetrator, and victim, (Parts 4-6) intended to
estimate the number of children who were victims of stereotypical
kidnappings and to obtain a sample of these cases for in-depth study.","['national incidence studies', 'missing children', 'abducted children', 'runaway children', 'thrownaway children', ""missing children's assistance act"", 'office of juvenile justice', 'delinquency prevention', 'standardized definition', 'law enforcement study']","['child abuse', 'child advocacy', 'child custody', 'child neglect', 'child welfare', 'juvenile courts', 'juvenile delinquency', 'juvenile justice', 'missing children', 'runaway children']","national incidence studies,abducted children,runaway children,thrownaway children,missing children's assistance act,office of juvenile justice,delinquency prevention,standardized definition,law enforcement study"

38918,"<p>Current research that seeks to inform terrorism prevention, intervention, and interdiction efforts has been hampered by at least three problems: the lack of adequate control groups, a tendency to conceptually conflate radicalization with mobilization, and a preponderance of research designs that only include data on the perpetrator or the event, but not both. This project addresses these shortcomings by collecting data that includes control groups consisting of non-violent offenders, non-mobilized ideologues, and unsuccessful terrorists, and by modeling mobilization as the interaction between individual characteristics, social networks, and event-level situational opportunities for action. The integrated approach of this research isolates the interactive factors that distinguish violent from nonviolent offenders, identifies the individual, network, and event-level variables that are significantly related to extremist mobilization, and determines which law enforcement interdiction strategies are most likely to succeed in stopping terrorist attacks.</p> <p>This research expands on the NIJ-funded Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS) and Social Networks of American Radicals (SoNAR) datasets to include event-level information on more than 1,400 United States-based extremist plots and financial crimes from 1974-2021. These event data can be linked to data on the individuals and networks contained in the PIRUS and SoNAR datasets, respectively, in order to build a fully relational database on radicalization characteristics, social-network dynamics, and event-level details and outcomes. Data collection used open-sources, including media reports, unsealed court documents, unclassified government reports, and other open-source archived content. To strengthen the reliability and validity of the analyses, at least 25% of the data were double coded, and the project team dedicated the last phase of data collection to conduct rigorous quality control. To analyze these data, the project team used three methods: descriptive and bivariate analyses, advanced regression methods with regularization, and multi-step configurational methods on a subset of 50 event cases.</p> <p>These data are currently available as an Excel workbook.

21942,"<p>The overall purpose of this study was to examine the influence of
variations in early childcare histories on the psychological
development of infants and toddlers from a variety of family
backgrounds. This general objective was addressed through a
prospective, longitudinal study of the experiences of 1,364 children and
their families, which took into account the
complex interactions among child characteristics and those
of the human and physical environments in which
the children were reared.</p>
<head type=""1"">Research Goals</head>
<p>The specific research aims were as follows:</p>
<list type=""bulleted"">
<itm><p>Examining the relationship between infants' childcare
arrangements (defined in terms of hours, type, quality, and
stability of care and the age at which the child entered care)
and children's concurrent and long-term development.
Specifically, the study investigated the association between
children's experiences in childcare and their social, emotional,
language, and cognitive development. The social-emotional
assessments included measures of attachment, independence,
compliance, behavior problems, prosocial and antisocial behavior,
and general competence in interacting with peers. Cognitive variables
include general developmental level and problem solving skills. Language
assessments incorporated measures of children's expressive and receptive communicative competence.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Examining whether the social ecology of the home
moderates the effects of childcare, i.e., whether children
from different home environments are differentially affected by
similar childcare experiences. The study examined the
moderating effects of parents' values and attitudes,
psychological adjustment and mental health, stress and social
support, child-rearing practices, time use, interactions with the
child, the marital relationship, and family demographics.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Examining whether individual differences among children
moderate the effects of infant care on child development. The
study examined the moderating effects of such child
characteristics as age, sex, health, birth order, and
temperament.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Identify demographic and family characteristics
associated with families' childcare decisions. The study examined whether
specific childcare arrangements are related to
the parents' social class, marital status, psychological
adjustment and personality, child-rearing values and attitudes,
parenting practices, stress, social support, marital
relationship, and the availability of childcare in the community.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Provide a natural history of infant care in the
1990s, and help establish a baseline of data pertaining to the
kinds of care being used by families. Whereas other national
databases, such as those provided by the United States Census Bureau, provide
static estimates of the number of children in different types of
childcare, this network study supplements that knowledge
with longitudinal data on successive enrollments into day care at
various ages, patterns of arrangements used concurrently and over
time, and the stability of arrangements during the first three
years of life. One of the most valuable aspects of the
collaborative study is the opportunity it provides to obtain a
more complete and accurate picture of patterns of infant care
used by families today. Census surveys use only gross categories
of care (e.g., center vs. in-home). In this study, more fine-grained
information regarding the types of centers and home-care
facilities was gathered.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Examine the consequences for families of maternal
employment and childcare choices. Family relationships,
parental mental health, family stress, and so on, are not just
inputs to child development or moderators of childcare effects,
they are also outcomes. High-quality childcare may alleviate
family stress and enhance parental adjustment. Low-quality childcare may add to the stress parents experience. Although the main
focus in the study was on the effect of childcare on the child, the
study also examined the effect of childcare on the family.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Identify demographic characteristics of childcare
associated with childcare quality. Of interest to policy makers
is another aspect of the study, the investigation of those
regulatory characteristics that predict care of higher quality.
These characteristics included the level and type of caregiver
training, the size of the childcare group, the auspices of the
childcare program (public/private, profit/nonprofit,
independent/chain, employer-sponsored/church-based), whether the
facility was licensed or unlicensed, the level of payment and
fees, and whether the caregiver was a relative of the family.</p></itm></list>

The psychometric and distributional qualities of the variables along with site differences were examined. A set of variables that was psychometrically and distributionally acceptable to be used in analytic analyses was designed to test the study hypotheses. These data files comprise Parts 1-49 of the study data material.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Supplemental Data Sets -- New and revised analysis variables as well as across-time mean scores and primary composites were produced as a supplement to the original Analytical Data Sets. These data files comprise Parts 50-55 of the study data material.</p></itm>
<itm><p>Raw Census-Related Data Sets -- Files were produced using geocoded addresses for survey respondents to match block group level data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses for investigators to create additional measures of interest from the geocoded addresses.

 that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
 behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to
 gauge various aspects of human development, including individual
 differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One such
 measure was the School Interview protocol. This was adapted from the
 school section of the Youth Interview Schedule used in the
 Philadelphia Family Management Study. It included sections addressing
 school climate, school safety, types of classes the subject had taken,

situation. Other questions examined the spending unit head's
occupation, and the nature and amount of the spending unit's income,
debts, liquid assets, changes in liquid assets, savings, investment
preferences, and actual and expected purchases of cars and other major

Specifically, the study looked at treatment compliance and effectiveness among men referred for mental health treatment in a program for men in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who were court ordered to receive batterer counseling, from 2004 to 2006. The final sample includes a total of 992 men, 478 men who were referred to treatment and 514 men who were not. The study included a service-delivery evaluation of the screening and referral and an outcome evaluation of the supplemental mental health counseling. The outcome evaluation was based on a quasi-experimental design comparing a subsample of men under a mandatory referral to those under a voluntary referral, and also men who actually obtained mental health treatment to those who were referred but untreated. Data were collected using questionnaires administered to both the men and their female partners over a 12 month period following intake into the counseling program, as well as clinical and arrest records to assess the extent to which the men complied with the referrals, their responses to the referral, and the outcomes from participation in the program, measured in terms of re-assault of their female partners.","['mental health screening', 'referral compliance', 'treatment effectiveness', 'batterer counseling programs', 'court ordered', 'pittsburgh pennsylvania', 'quasi-experimental design', 'mandatory referral', 'voluntary referral', 're-assault prevention']","['domestic violence', 'drug treatment', 'intervention strategies', 'mandatory sentences', 'mental health services', 'pretrial intervention', 'probation services', 'treatment compliance', 'treatment programs', 'victim services']","mental health screening,referral compliance,treatment effectiveness,batterer counseling programs,court ordered,pittsburgh pennsylvania,quasi-experimental design,mandatory referral,voluntary referral,re-assault prevention"

The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts' (AOUSC) criminal file. Defendants in criminal cases may be either individuals or corporations. There is one record for each defendant in each case filed. Included in the records are data from court proceedings and offense codes for up to five offenses charged at the time the case was filed. (The most serious charge at termination may differ from the most serious charge at case filing, due to plea bargaining or action of the judge or jury.) In a case with multiple charges against the defendant, a ""most serious"" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables, or ""SAF variables,"" that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 4.1-4.5 and 5.1-5.6. Variables containing information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals.

37499,"<p>In the years 2014 through 2019, three U.S. universities, Michigan State University, the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and The University of Utah, received Language Proficiency Flagship Initiative grants as part of the larger Language Flagship, which is a National Security Education Program (NSEP) and Defense Language and National Security Education Office (DLNSEO) initiative to improve language learning in the United States. The goal of the three universities' Language Proficiency Flagship Initiative grants was to document language proficiency in regular tertiary foreign language programs so that the programs, and ones like them at other universities, could use the proficiency-achievement data to set programmatic learning benchmarks and recommendations, as called for by the Modern Language Association in 2007. This call was reiterated by the National Standards Collaborative Board in 2015.</p><p>During the first three years of the three, university-specific five-year grants (Fall 2014 through Spring 2017), each university collected language proficiency data during academic years 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017, from language learners in selected, regular language programs to document the students' proficiency achievements.</p><p>University A tested Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish with the NSEP grant funding, and German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese with additional (in-kind) financial support from within University A.</p><p>University B tested Arabic, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish with the NSEP grant funding, and German and Korean with additional (in-kind) financial support from University B.</p><p>University C tested Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, and Russian with the NSEP grant funding, and Korean with additional (in-kind) financial support from University C.</p><p>Each university additionally provided the students background questionnaires at the time of testing. As stipulated by the grant terms, at the universities, students were offered to take up to three proficiency tests each semester: speaking, listening, and reading. Writing was not assessed because the grants did not financially cover the costs of writing assessments. The universities were required by grant terms to use official, nationally recognized, and standardized language tests that reported scores out on one of two standardized proficiency test scales: either the American Councils of Teaching Foreign Languages (ACTFL, 2012) proficiency scale, or the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR: Herzog, n.d.) proficiency scale. The three universities thus contracted mostly with Language Testing International, ACTFL's official testing subsidiary, to purchase and administer to students the Oral Proficiency Interview - computer (OPIc) for speaking, the Listening Proficiency Test (LPT) for listening, and the Reading
Proficiency Test (RPT) for reading. However, earlier in the grant cycling, because ACTFL did not yet have tests in all of the languages to be tested, some of the earlier testing was contracted with American Councils and Avant STAMP, even though those tests are not specifically geared for the specific populations of learners present in the given project.</p><p>Students were able to opt out of testing in certain cases; those cases varied from university to university. The speaking tests occurred normally within intact classes that came into computer labs to take the tests. Students were often times requested to take the listening and reading tests outside of class time in proctored language labs on the campuses on walk-in bases, or they took the listening and reading tests in a language lab during a regular class setting. These decisions were often made by the language instructors and/or the language programs. The data are cross-sectional, but certain individuals took the tests repeatedly, thus, longitudinal data sets are nested within the cross-sectional data.</p><p>The three universities worked mostly independently during the initial year of data collection because the identities of the three universities receiving the grants was not announced until weeks before testing was to begin at all three campuses. Thus, each university independently designed its background questionnaire. However, because all three were guided by the same set of grant-rules to use nationally-recognized standardized tests for the assessments, combining all three universities' test data was rather simple. During year two of data collection, the three universities organized to produce a more unified background questionnaire that would pose many of the same questions to students during the final third (2017) year of testing. Thus, this data deposit project, beyond the test scores and simple background data from all three years of testing, also contains data from the students' 2017 background questionnaire questions that were common across all three university background questionnaires.</p><p>Acknowledgements: The projects benefited over the years from the help of the following individuals: Daniel R.

3281,"The State of Maine Department of Corrections (MDOC) and the
Office of Substance Abuse (OSA) at the Maine Department of Mental
Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services opened the Key
Maine Therapeutic Community (TC) in March 1999, and its Transitional
Treatment Program (TTP) for adult male inmates in January
2000. Spectrum Behavioral Services, Inc. (SBC) was subcontracted to
implement the program, which was located at the Maine Correctional
Facility in South Windham and the Pre-Release Center in Hallowell. The
United States Department of Justice Residential Substance Abuse
Treatment (RSAT) funded the initiative. This study was undertaken as a
process evaluation of the program. To accomplish the aims of the
process evaluation, research staff examined both program and
client-level data that were collected throughout the first 15 months
of the Key Maine TC's operation, a period that included the initial
start-up period for the TTP. Part 1, Baseline Data, contains
information on inmates, including age, ethnic group, education level,
timing of all diplomas or degrees they had received, reasons for
stopping school, marital and/or relationship status and history, and
number and ages of children. The file also includes information on the
last six months before being incarcerated, such as attendance at
religious services, kind of housing and time spent there, as well as
whom they lived with and the behavior of the inmate and their living
companions in terms of alcohol and drug use. Also, there is
information about how respondents supported themselves financially,
including employment status and job information, such as number of
days worked, number of jobs, part-time or full-time status, income,
supplemental income, drug and alcohol use effects on employment, and
whether they had dependants to support. In addition to information on
the six months before incarceration, the file provides information on
the inmate's substance abuse behaviors over his lifetime, including
specific drugs used, the frequency used, and the age at which use of
particular substances began. Information on substance abuse behaviors,
such as specific substances used and frequency used in the last 30
days, is also recorded. Other variables in Part 1 focus on whether
inmates' substance abuse had caused problems in major areas of their
lives, such as family, employment, school, physical and mental health,
relationships, and other substance abuse treatment received, including
the type of treatment, duration of treatment, main substance abused,
and reasons for entering treatment. Self-report data are available on
each inmate's lifetime history of illegal activities, including, but
not limited to, arrest history. This includes the offense(s) for which
the inmate was currently serving time, as well as past offenses, jail
time served, number of times incarcerated, illegal activities in which
the inmate engaged during the last six months before incarceration,
and time spent in probation during the last six months before
incarceration. Information on visitors received during time in jail
and contact (phone calls and letters) with others while in jail are
included, as well as personal history information concerning the
inmate's relationship with family and the activities they engaged in
together. There is information on the friends the inmate had during
the six months before incarceration, such as their education level,
employment status, and relationship with family. Additional variables
include whether the inmate reported having a history of child abuse,
with details such as age at time of abuse, relationship with the
abuser, frequency of abuse, perceived association of child abuse
history to the inmate's substance abuse, the inmate's history as both
victim of and perpetrator of violent crimes and weapon use, the
inmate's sexual activity during the six months before incarceration,
and his opinions about the chances of contracting HIV/AIDS. Other
items pertain to behaviors that increase the risk of contracting
HIV/AIDS and the inmates' feelings about HIV/AIDS, such as whether
they worried about contracting the virus, whether they would want to
know if they had the virus, whether they knew how to protect
themselves, whether they had altered their behavior to reduce their
chances of infection, and their perceptions regarding the likelihood
of contracting HIV/AIDS. Part 1 data also provide information on
inmates' physical and mental health, along with medications taken and
diagnosed mental disorders. Interviewers' ratings concerning the
inmates' behavior during the interview and whether the interviewer
believed the inmates would complete the program are assessed across 16
areas. Part 2, Retention Data, indicates how long inmates spent in the
program and the reason for their discharge. Part 3, Score Data,
provides the inmates' psychological and motivational scores for the
short self-esteem index, the short depression index, motivation and
readiness and treatment engagement, and when they were tested. Also
included are scores for counselor rapport and counselor
competence. Part 4, Services Data, records the number of times an
inmate had used particular services, such as clinical groups, clinical
supervision, educational sessions, encounter groups, group counseling
sessions, individual counseling sessions, seminars, and 12-step
sessions.","['substance abuse treatment', 'inmate rehabilitation', 'process evaluation', 'therapeutic community', 'transitional treatment', 'correctional facility', 'mental health', 'data collection', 'program assessment', 'risk behavior analysis']","['alternatives to institutionalization', 'correctional facilities', 'drug treatment', 'inmate rehabilitation', 'mental health services', 'parole system', 'prisoner reentry', 'substance abuse treatment', 'therapeutic community', 'transitional care']","inmate rehabilitation,therapeutic community,transitional treatment,correctional facility,data collection,program assessment,risk behavior analysis"

2087,"The National Household Education Survey (NHES) series
reports information on the condition of education in the United States
by collecting data at the household level rather than using a
traditional school-based data collection system. The surveys attempt
to address many current issues in education, such as preprimary
education, school safety and discipline, adult education, and
activities related to citizenship. This survey includes two topical
survey components: the Adult Education (AE) component, which collected
information about adults' participation in adult education, and the
Early Childhood Program Participation (ECPP) component, which focused
on children's participation in nonparental childcare and early
childhood programs. The AE component explored the participation of
adults (aged 16 years and older) in a wide range of educational
activities during the 12 months prior to the interview. Respondents
were asked about their participation in seven broadly-defined types of
adult education activities: adult basic skills and GED preparation
classes, English As a Second Language instruction, courses taken
toward college degrees or vocational diplomas or certificates,
apprenticeship programs, career or job-related courses, any other
formally structured courses, and computer-only or video-only
instruction on the job. The AE component also collected data
pertaining to reasons for and barriers to participation in adult
education. In all, 19,722 adult interviews were completed: 11,713 with
adult education participants and 8,009 with nonparticipants. The ECPP
component examined children's early experiences in various types of
nonparental childcare arrangements and early childhood programs. The
core of this survey collected extensive information on children's
participation and experiences in four types of nonparental care and
programs: care by relatives (not including parents), care by
nonrelatives, Head Start programs, and other center-based
programs. Other information collected in this component concerned
children's kindergarten and primary school experiences, children's
personal and household demographic characteristics, parent/guardian
characteristics, literacy-related home activities, and children's
health and disability status. In total, interviews were completed for
14,064 children who were newborn through age 10 and in 3rd grade and
below. This includes interviews for 4,135 infants and toddlers, 3,431
preschool children, 1,680 kindergarten children, 4,717 primary school
children, and 101 home-schooled children.","['education survey', 'household data', 'adult education', 'early childhood', 'nonparental care', 'educational participation', 'school safety', 'literacy activities', 'demographic characteristics', 'program participation']","['adult education', 'early childhood education', 'educational participation', 'household characteristics', 'literacy education', 'preschool education', 'program participation', 'public school students', 'school safety', 'school vouchers']","education survey,household data,nonparental care,educational participation,literacy activities,program participation"

information on demographic characteristics of respondents such as
gender, age, marital status, information on non-coresident spouses,
religion, education, main occupational activity, and housing
structure, including size, materials, availability of electricity,
home ownership, and rent. Questions were also posed regarding
household economy and an inventory of household consumption was taken,
including the value of foods purchased and self-produced in the last
week, purchases of personal care and household items during the last
month, and purchases of durable goods in the last year. Respondents
were also asked about
the location of their health care providers and the
travel time and travel cost to see them. Retrospective life histories
were gathered from women regarding children ever born, pregnancy
outcomes and infant feeding, and contraceptive knowledge and use,
along with information about menarche and menopause. In addition,
detailed pregnancy histories from women aged 50 years and older were
collected. Information regarding children under age 15 was gathered by

Information was collected on whether respondents thought that there would be a major earthquake in the United States in the next 20 years, whether the federal government was adequately prepared to deal with a major earthquake, whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the Tea Party movement, whether they approved of the way Joe Biden was handling his job as vice president, whether they approved of the way Michelle Obama was handling her role as first lady, whether they approved of the way that Hillary Clinton was handling her job as secretary of state, whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Sarah Palin, and whether they would like to see Sarah Palin run for president in 2012. Respondents were asked whether they thought that the views of the people in the Tea Party movement generally reflect the views of most Americans, whether they thought that autism was a serious problem, how likely they thought it would be that in their lifetime there would be a cure for autism, whether they thought the housing market in their area would get better or worse in the next year, whether they currently rented their home, or bought it with a mortgage, or had their home entirely paid for. Finally respondents were asked how they felt about financial companies paying their employee bonuses after receiving bailout money from the government, whether they thought these bonuses were a major economic problem, who they thought benefited most from the bailout, whether they had enough income to save money or whether they had just enough to meet bills and obligations, and what social class they would say they belonged to.

1271,"This paper uses a currency crisis framework to analyze the
 currency devaluation and debt default of post-Soviet Russia in August
 1998. The authors show that even though the Russian economy recorded
 positive growth immediately preceding the default, the atmosphere was
 reflective of an impending crisis. The authors then consider the
 symptoms of a currency crisis -- specifically public and private debt
 responsibilities, devaluation expectations, and contractionary
 monetary policy -- and show that they were present in Russia at that
 time. Three generations of currency crisis models are reviewed,
 followed by speculation that the Russian default was a product not
 only of fiscal deficits but also of a fragile financial system and
 contractionary monetary policy. The authors address the possibility
 that the usual prescription for a currency crisis, that is, increasing
 interest rates, may have accelerated the default and that a
 case-by-case prescription may afford a better solution than a blanket
policy of increasing interest rates in the face of devaluation.","['currency crisis', 'russia 1998', 'debt default', 'economic growth', 'impending crisis', 'public debt', 'private debt', 'monetary policy', 'fiscal deficits', 'financial system']","['economic crises', 'economic growth', 'financial system', 'fiscal policy', 'government debt', 'international monetary fund', 'monetary policy', 'public debt', 'russian federation', 'sovereign debt']","currency crisis,russia 1998,debt default,impending crisis,public debt,private debt,fiscal deficits,financial system"
2739,"These data explore the impact of job loss and unemployment
 on workers' stress and mental health, and evaluate the potential
 benefits of participation in a job-search skills seminar. Respondents
 were recruited from four offices of the Michigan Employment Security
 Commission (MESC) in southeastern Michigan. A group of 31,560
 unemployed persons were approached for the study. Of these, about
 23,000 failed to meet basic initial criteria because they were new
 entrants to the labor market, already re-employed, or just
 accompanying others in line. Respondents were kept in the pool if they
 were not on strike and not expecting to be recalled for work in the
 next few months or planning to retire in the next two years. The
 resulting group of 7,956 were then assessed for symptoms of depression
 and willingness to participate in a job-seeking skills seminar. These
 final exclusion criteria resulted in a pool of 3,402. A screening
 questionnaire (Part 1) was administered to that pool, which allowed
 the researchers to classify respondents as being at high risk for
 depression and anxiety or at low risk. All of the high-risk
 respondents and a random sample of the low-risk participants were
 invited to participate in the study and in the MESC's Job
 Opportunities and Basic Skills II (JOBSII) intervention program, which
 consisted of a set of job-search skills seminars. JOBS II was
 patterned after JOBS I, which was offered by the MESC in the late
 1980s. A pretest questionnaire (Part 2) was mailed to respondents
 between February and July 1991, two weeks prior to the invitation to
 participate in the JOBS intervention seminar. The questionnaire
 addressed the situation surrounding the respondents' loss of
 employment, quality of work life in previous job, level of economic
 hardship, attitudes toward obtaining a new job, social support
 network, self-esteem, feelings of anxiety and/or depression, health
 problems, and substance abuse history and related problems. At the
 same time, a mail questionnaire was sent to each respondent's
 significant other (Part 6). Items in this questionnaire focused on the
 length of their relationship with the respondent, the level of support
 given to the respondent, the significant other's observations
 regarding the daily activities of the respondent during this period of
 job loss, the significant other's feelings of anxiety and/or
 depression, and the significant other's level of economic hardship. A
 second and third mail questionnaire were sent six weeks (Part 3) and
 six months (Part 4) after the respondents' participation in a JOBS
 intervention program job-seeking skills seminar. For those respondents
 who had gained employment, questions were asked regarding current
 employment status, sense of job permanence, employee benefits, and
 feelings toward current job. Those respondents still seeking
 employment were queried about their intention to continue their job
 search, job-seeking behaviors, confidence in their ability to obtain a
 job, and the presence or lack of a social support network. For those
 respondents still unemployed six months after the intervention
 seminar, additional questions covered receipt of unemployment benefits
 and how necessary those benefits were. Similarly, significant others
 were queried both six weeks (Part 7) and six months (Part 8) after the
 respondents' participation in the job intervention. Topics focused on
 their relationship with the respondent, the observed daily activities
 of the respondent, the emotional support given to the respondent, the
 respondent's job-seeking behavior, the respondent's and significant
 other's feelings of anxiety and/or depression, and the level of shared
 responsibility regarding the payment of bills and other economic
 hardships. Finally, respondents were questioned through a mail survey
 two years (Part 5) after their participation in the intervention
 seminar about their employment status, quality of work life, financial
 strain endured, social support system, relationship satisfaction,
 self-esteem, feelings of anxiety and/or depression, health, and sense
 of control. Significant others were also queried after two years (Part
 9) regarding their relationship with the respondent, the significant
 other's familiarity with the respondent's feelings of anxiety and/or
 depression, their social support network, and the significant other's
 feelings of anxiety and/or depression. Background information on
 respondents includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent, education,
 marital status, age of children in household, number of financial
 dependents, and household income. Background information on
 significant others includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent,
 education, and employment status. Following the conclusion of the JOBS
 intervention program, respondents were asked to complete a mail
 questionnaire (Part 10) evaluating the effectiveness of the program
 agenda and assessing the relevance of the seminar to their job search,
 the effectiveness of the seminar trainers, inoculation against
 setbacks, impact on their self-esteem, effect on their interviewing
skills, and resume preparedness.","['job loss', 'unemployment effects', 'mental health', 'job-search seminar', 'depression risk', 'economic hardship', 'social support', 'employment status', 'intervention evaluation', 'significant others']","['depression', 'economic aid', 'employment discrimination', 'job loss', 'job satisfaction', 'job search', 'job security', 'job training', 'mental health', 'unemployment effects']","unemployment effects,job-search seminar,depression risk,economic hardship,intervention evaluation,significant others"

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Bureau of Police for the years 1990 through
2001. Data on crime offense reports were collected from the Rochester,
New York Police Department from January 1991 through December 2001.
The Rochester CAD drug calls and shots fired calls were collected from
January 1993 through May 2001. A total of 1,643,828 records (769,293
crime offense and 874,535 CAD) were collected from Pittsburgh, while
538,893 records (530,050 crime offense and 8,843 CAD) were collected
from Rochester. ArcView 3.3 and GDT Dynamap 2000 Street centerline
maps were used to address match the data, with some of the Pittsburgh
data being cleaned to fix obvious errors and increase address match
percentages. A SAS program was used to eliminate duplicate CAD calls
based on time and location of the calls. For the 1990 through 1999
Pittsburgh crime offense data, the address match rate was 91 percent.
The match rate for the 2000 through 2001 Pittsburgh crime offense data
was 72 percent. The Pittsburgh CAD data address match rate for 1990
through 1999 was 85 percent, while for 2000 through 2001 the match
rate was 100 percent because the new CAD system supplied incident
coordinates. The address match rates for the Rochester crime offenses

Study One (Part 1, Study One Quantitative Data) was developed to refine and offer preliminary validation of the draft processes of resistance measure. In the summer of 2004, group facilitators collected data from 346 domestic violence offenders recruited from domestic violence agencies in Florida, California, Georgia, and Rhode Island. The 88 item draft processes of resistance measure was administered as part of a 280 item paper-and-pencil survey that took approximately 60 minutes to complete. Resistance items were placed in random order in the measure and in 50 percent of the surveys, resistance items were placed in reverse order within the measure. Study Two (Part 2, Study Two Quantitative Data), administered the processes of resistance measure to a separate sample of domestic violence offenders at batterer program intake and again two months later. Participants included 358 domestic violence offenders recruited from domestic violence agencies in Florida, Virginia, Rhode Island, Michigan, and Calgary, Canada, between January and December 2005.
In Study Three (Part 3, Study Three Expert Interview Qualitative Data), 16 of the 18 domestic violence experts who were interviewed in Study One during the drafting of the resistance measure were invited by telephone or email to participate in a 1-
hour interview on best practices for dealing with resistance. Thirteen experts who agreed to be interviewed were mailed a list of processes of resistance measure items and asked to give recommendations on how domestic violence counselors can respond to a client engaging in those behaviors in treatment. Interviews were conducted by telephone in November 2005, with an interviewer and note taker, and audiotaped. Part 1 (Study One Quantitative Data) and Part 2 (Study Two Quantitative Data) include demographic variables such as age, race, level of education, employment and income level, relationship to the domestic assault victim, months in batterer treatment, and criminal history.

4673,"The Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) was administered for the first time in 1997 by the United States Bureau of the Census, for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). CJRP replaced the Census of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter Facilities, also known as the Children in Custody (CIC) census, which had been conducted since the early 1970s. The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC collected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g., number of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP, which is conducted biennially, collects an individual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to provide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. In 1997, the reference date was the fifth Wednesday in October. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected. Each record in the data that provides information about a juvenile also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held. Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The census was not sent to adult facilities or to facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children.","['juvenile justice', 'residential placement', 'census administration', 'data collection', 'facility characteristics', 'treatment services', 'individual records', 'biennial survey', 'juvenile custody', 'facility population']","['alternatives to institutionalization', 'assessment', 'census data', 'correctional facilities (juveniles)', 'juvenile courts', 'juvenile delinquency', 'juvenile justice', 'juvenile offenders', 'residential programs', 'treatment facilities']","residential placement,census administration,data collection,facility characteristics,treatment services,individual records,biennial survey,juvenile custody,facility population"

24603,"This poll, fielded January 9-12, 2008, is a part of continuing series of monthly polls that solicit public opinion on various political and social
issues. A national sample of 1,130 adults was surveyed, including an oversample of African Americans, for a total of 202 African American respondents.
Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling his job as president and other issues such as the situation in
Iraq and the economy, and whether they thought things in the country were going in the right direction.
This poll focused on the 2008 presidential election, and asked respondents what was the single most important issue in their choice for
president, how closely they had been following the presidential race, how likely they were to vote in the 2008 presidential primary or caucus in their
state, and which candidate they would vote for if the Democratic and Republican primaries were being held that day.
Iowa and New Hampshire residents were asked whether they voted in the 2008 primaries in their states and for whom they voted.
Respondents were asked for their opinions of the 2008 presidential candidates, including which Democratic and Republican candidates they trusted to
handle issues such as health care, the United States campaign against terrorism, immigration, and international affairs, which types of characteristics
were important to them in a candidate, which candidate would bring the most change to Washington, and which candidate had the best chance to get elected
as president in November 2008.
Several questions asked whether respondents were more or less enthusiastic about the candidates based on the possibility that they could become the first president who was
African American, female, Mormon, 72 years old when elected, or a Baptist minister, whether being African American would help or hurt Barack Obama's
candidacy, and whether the country needed a president to lead the nation in the same direction as George W. Bush.
Additional topics included abortion, respondents' economic and financial situation, and the war in Iraq.
Demographic information includes sex, age, race, education level, household income, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural),
whether respondents rented or owned their home, voter registration status and participation history, political party affiliation, political
philosophy, marital status, religious preference, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.","['public opinion', 'political issues', 'national sample', 'african american', 'presidential approval', '2008 election', 'candidate trust', 'demographic information', 'voter participation', 'social issues']","['african americans', 'political attitudes', 'presidential elections', 'public opinion', 'race relations', 'social issues', 'voter participation', 'voting behavior', 'voting patterns', 'voting preference']","national sample,african american,2008 election,candidate trust,demographic information"

Before the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003, it was not clear the extent to which state departments of corrections (DOCs) were addressing sexual violence in systematic ways. In fact, little information existed about what strategies were being put into practice in prison systems across the country. PREA changed the way DOCs addressed prison sexual violence (PSV). Mandatory recordkeeping and a push for eliminating such incidents moved
many DOCs to develop specific responses to PSV or to further refine approaches already in place. The purpose of this project was to provide a national snapshot of DOC initiatives to address PSV, as well as to identify specific practices that seemed to be, in the absence of formal evaluations, particularly promising or innovative in nature.
</p>
<p>
Researchers conducted three tasks: (1) The Survey of State Correctional Administrators (SSCA) involving written surveys and follow-up phone interviews with leaders of state DOCs. During the survey, state administrators described the state's overall approach to PSV and nominated specific strategies as particularly promising; (2) The Survey of Promising Practices (SPP) involving phone interviews with DOC representatives who spoke about promising practices nominated during the SSCA. Interviews were conducted with facility directors, service providers, or other state personnel affiliated with nominated approaches; and (3) Case studies involving site visits to states that researchers determined could provide the most informative lessons on addressing sexual violence in prison to the largest audience of practitioners, researchers, and policymakers.
</p>
<p>
The collection includes 2 Access databases, one each for the SSCA (ASCA_4_6_2006.directors.mdb) and the SSP (ASCA_FAC_4_6_2006.prompractices.mdb).  The data related to the Case Studies are not available at this time.

enacted in 1994. The program provided grants to states to be used to
increase the capacity of state correctional systems to confine serious
and violent offenders. This national evaluation addressed four broad
areas: (1) How had the federal government implemented the law? How
much money had been made available and what were the criteria for
disbursement? (2) How had the states reacted legislatively to the law?
Did states adopt truth-in-sentencing or statutes having equivalent
effect? (3) How had the state VOI/TIS money been spent and for what?
How much did it increased prison capacities? (4) Did the law increase
the number of admissions, length of sentences, and terms served for
violent offenders? In addition to these four major areas, the study
looked at related areas of interest, such as the impact of VOI/TIS and
other ""get tough"" legislation on prosecutorial and judicial attitudes,
policies, and practices. It also examined state spending on
corrections, particularly for construction. The researchers
collaborated with the American Correctional Association (ACA), the
American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI), and the Justice
Management Institute (JMI) to conduct special surveys among state
correctional officials, prosecutors, and judges. The ACA surveyed
state departments of correction in the summer of 1998. States were
asked to indicate the extent of changes in a number of prison
operations and activities since 1996, when VOI/TIS funds became
available. In the summer of 1999 the APRI surveyed prosecutors
nationwide to ascertain their perceptions of the effects of ""get
tough"" legislation (including TIS) on a number of dimensions. In the
fall of 1999, the JMI surveyed judges nationwide on their impressions
of the effectiveness of several ""get tough"" measures in their states,
including VOI/TIS. In Part 1, American Correctional Association Survey
Data, state correction departments were questioned on the amount of
VOI/TIS funds spent by their state since 1996, number of beds added
using VOI/TIS funds and in what types of facilities, how VOI/TIS funds
were used to increase number of beds, average prison sentences in 1993
and 1998 for different types of offenses, average time actually served
in 1993 and 1998 for those offenses, the effects of VOI/TIS on prison
and jail admissions for different types of offenders, and its effects
on the composition of the prison population, prison inmate activities
and programs, prison staffing, and prison operations. In Part 2,
American Prosecutors Research Institute Survey Data, prosecutors were
questioned about what ""get tough"" policies their states had enacted,
the efficacy of ""get tough"" policies in achieving their goals, whether
these policies had unanticipated or negative consequences, expected
results of these policies, the percentage of cases to which these
policies applied, the extent to which these policies had helped
accomplish their office's goals, the effects of ""get tough"" policies
on budget and resources, sentences and time actually served, and the
criminal justice process, the size of their jurisdiction, and the
number of staff in their office. In Part 3, Justice Management
Institute Survey Data, judges were questioned about whether their
state had enacted ""get tough"" policies in the past ten years, what
kinds of policies were adopted, their effect on the efficiency of case
processing, the formal positions of the Judicial Council and Judges
Association on the policies, whether the respondent or other judges
had input into the policies, how likely ""get tough"" policies were to
achieve certain goals, what results the respondent expected from the
policies, the impact of the policies on the criminal justice process,
years experience on the bench, the percentage of their caseload that
involved criminal cases, whether they handled civil, family
law/domestic relations, or juvenile cases, and the population of their
jurisdiction.","['voi/tis evaluation', 'federal implementation', 'state legislation', 'prison capacity', 'sentencing policies', 'prosecutorial attitudes', 'judicial perspectives', 'correctional spending', 'survey data', 'criminal justice process']","['criminal justice policy', 'judicial decision making', 'judicial process', 'parole system', 'prison overcrowding', 'prison sentences', 'sentencing guidelines', 'sentencing reform', 'state courts', 'state legislation']","voi/tis evaluation,federal implementation,state legislation,prison capacity,sentencing policies,prosecutorial attitudes,judicial perspectives,correctional spending,survey data,criminal justice process"

4212,"This study aimed to further evaluate previous findings
regarding drug use and criminal behaviors among the criminal
population by investigating the effectiveness of two Colorado
Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Therapeutic Communities (RSAT
TC) for offenders. The first, the Crossroad to Freedom House
Therapeutic Community at the Arrowhead Correctional Center (ACC TC)
was a prison-based program. The second was the community-based Peer I
Therapeutic Community (Peer I). Two methodologies were used to gather
data. Part 1, RSAT Outcome Data, contains quantitative data collected
from five separate study groups of differing sample sizes that
received differing levels of treatment, with a total of 778 cases. The
groups were compared on five separate outcome variables: technical
violation, new misdemeanor arrest, new felony arrest, return to
prison, and overall supervision failure. To gather baseline
information from participants, a researcher administered the intake
packet in group format to participants within three weeks of admission
to ACC TC. After completing the treatment programs, outcome data were
collected for a two-year follow-up period for each participant. Part
2, Case Studies, consists of case studies of ten participants, two
from each of the above five listed groups. One from each group had
successful outcomes, and one did not. Successful outcomes were defined
as participants who were still living in the community after 12 to 18
months without any new charges. Unsuccessful outcomes were defined as
those participants who were returned to prison for technical
violations or new charges and were eligible for study only if they had
been living in the community for six to twelve months before returning
to prison. Information for the case studies were gathered through
interviews with both former prisoners and one of their significant
others. Variables for Part 1 include demographic information, length
of stay in both the ACC TC and Peer I, types of programs parolees were
released to, and time period between leaving the Department of
Corrections and any subsequent returns. Information was also gathered
on the presence of psychological concerns as an adult, as well as in
childhood. Part 2 consists of information regarding ACC TC and Peer I
participants' post-treatment such as their employment status,
financial well-being, significant relationships, relapse information
and whether or not the interviewee has returned to the Department of
Corrections since receiving treatment and being released.","['drug use', 'criminal behaviors', 'therapeutic communities', 'colorado rsat', 'offender rehabilitation', 'treatment effectiveness', 'recidivism rates', 'quantitative data', 'case studies', 'post-treatment outcomes']","['alternative medicine', 'antisocial behavior', 'case management', 'drug abuse', 'drug courts', 'drug treatment', 'offender profiles', 'recidivism', 'therapeutic jurisprudence', 'treatment programs']","criminal behaviors,therapeutic communities,colorado rsat,offender rehabilitation,treatment effectiveness,quantitative data,case studies,post-treatment outcomes"

9176,"This data collection is part of a longitudinal survey
designed to provide detailed information on the economic situation of
households and persons in the United States. These data examine the
distribution of income, wealth, and poverty in American society and
gauge the effects of federal and state programs on the well-being of
families and individuals. There are three basic elements contained in
the survey. The first is a control card that records basic social and
demographic characteristics for each person in a household, as well as
changes in such characteristics over the course of the interviewing
period. The second element is the core portion of the questionnaire,
with questions repeated at each interview on labor force activity,
types and amounts of income, participation in various cash and noncash
benefit programs, attendance in postsecondary schools, private health
insurance coverage, public or subsidized rental housing, low-income
energy assistance, and school breakfast and lunch participation. The
third element consists of topical modules, which are series of
supplemental questions asked during selected household visits. Topical
modules were not created for the first or second waves of the 1985
panel. The topical module for Wave III contains information on assets
and liabilities. Included are questions on loans, IRAs, medical bills,
other debts, checking accounts, and savings bonds, as well as
questions related to mortgages, royalties, and other investments, real
estate property and vehicles, rental income, self-employment, and
stocks and mutual fund shares. The Wave IV topical module contains
information on fertility history, household relationships, marital
history, migration history, support for non-household members, and
work-related expenses. The topical module for Wave VI includes data on
child care arrangements, child support agreements, support for
non-household members, job offers, health status and utilization of
health care services, long-term care, and disability status of
children. Wave VII topical module contains information on assets and
liabilities. Included are questions on pension plan coverage, lump sum
distributions from pension plans, characteristics of job from which
retired, and characteristics of home financing arrangements.
Frequencies for each wave are also provided. Parts 27 and 28 of this
study are the unedited research files for Wave V and Wave VIII Topical
Modules, obtained from the Census Bureau. These files include data on

Mother and Infant Home Visiting Program Evaluation-Strong Start (MIHOPE-Strong Start) was a large-scale evaluation that rigorously tested the effectiveness  of evidence-based home visiting in improving birth and health outcomes during pregnancy and in the year after birth. Local programs included in the study's analysis implemented one of two evidence-based models: Healthy
Families America (HFA) or Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP). These models were chosen because earlier evaluations found some evidence of their having positive impacts on birth outcomes.
</p>
<p>
The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) of
the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) partnered with the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) of the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) of the
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to sponsor the study.
MIHOPE-Strong Start was part of the CMMI's Strong Start for Mothers and
Newborns Initiative, which evaluated whether enhanced, nonmedical prenatal
interventions, when provided in addition to routine medical care, have the
potential to improve birth outcomes and reduce health care costs for women
enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Under
contract with OPRE, MDRC conducted MIHOPE-Strong Start in collaboration with
James Bell Associates, Johns Hopkins University, Mathematica,
and New York University.
</p>
<p>
The analysis for MIHOPE-Strong Start included 2,899 women and 66
local programs (37 HFA and 29 NFP programs) operating across 17 states: California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin. Women were eligible for MIHOPE-Strong Start if they were pregnant and at least 8 weeks from their due date.
</p>
<p>
The MIHOPE-Strong Start analysis included a
subset of families and local programs that were recruited for MIHOPE, the
national evaluation of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting
(MIECHV) program. Specifically, the MIHOPE-Strong Start impact analysis included information on 46 local home visiting programs and 1,845 families that were initially recruited for MIHOPE but met the MIHOPE-Strong Start eligibility criteria. An important distinction between MIHOPE-Strong Start and MIHOPE is that MIHOPE included only programs receiving MIECHV funding, while MIHOPE-Strong Start included both MIECHV and non-MIECHV-funded programs.
</p>
<p>
In both studies, families were randomly assigned either to an evidence-based home visiting program or to a control group who was given information on other
services available in the community. The random assignment design was intended to create program and control groups that were similar when women
entered the study, so that systematic differences in the outcomes of interest observed between the two groups can be attributed to the home visiting
services rather than to the preexisting characteristics of the women.

 respondents' opinions on and concerns about privacy and sexual 
 harassment. Respondents were asked whether computers and technology, 
 companies keeping personal information on their customers, credit 
 agencies recording and disclosing credit information, and access to 
 public government records by third parties constituted invasions of 
 privacy. Respondents were polled on whether they worried about 
 government agencies or private companies like credit card companies 
 misusing their personal information or their personal information 
 being accessed by hackers or by persons monitoring their phone 
 conversations. In addition, respondents were asked whether they had 
 ever been a victim of information misuse, whether they were concerned 
 about the accuracy of public records about them, and whether there 
 should be laws governing third party access to personal information 
 without consumer consent, the inclusion of corrections and criticisms 
 of personal information, notification of the types of information 
 held by an organization about an individual, and access to one's 
 personal information for a minimal fee. Opinions were gathered on 
 President Clinton's handling of relations with North Korea, whether 
 the United Nations should have imposed a trade embargo on North 
 Korea, whether the United States and its allies should have taken 
 military action against North Korea, and whether dealings with North 
 Korea involved interests vital to the United States. Respondents were 
 also queried on whether sexual harassment in the workplace was a 
 problem in the United States, whether respondents themselves had ever 
 been harassed, and if they reported the harassment, the outcomes of 
 reporting the harassment, the reasons one may or may not report 
 sexual harassment, and whether the accuser or accused is more likely 
 to be believed in sexual harassment cases. Views were gathered on 
 whether it is easy or hard to legally file sexual harassment charges, 
 whether sexual harassment may be brought on by one's clothing and/or 
 behavior, whether President Clinton sexually harassed former Arkansas 
 state employee Paula Jones, and whether Supreme Court Justice

the personal and political backgrounds, political attitudes, and
relevant behavior of party leaders. Data are presented on delegates to
the 1976 Democratic National Convention. Questions focus on the
""representativeness"" of the party elites who were selected to go to
the National Convention and also probe for the leaders' views on a
number of important issues related to the ""reform"" era in the
political party and for their opinions on what a national party is and
should be. The representation of minorities and females in the process
received particular attention as did a comparison of the views of the
party professionals. Specific variables include characterization of the
respondent's political beliefs on the liberal-conservative scale,
length of time the respondent had been active in the Democratic party,

The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.

to study the lives of the peoples of East and Southeast Asia on
physical, psychological, and sociological dimensions. The project was
designed to capture the extent to which respondents experience the
affective and cognitive qualities of life, focusing on their
assessments of their own lives as well as their relationships to
family, neighborhood, workplace, social institutions, political
institutions, and the marketplace. Attitudes toward development,
democracy, and regionalization were examined, as were the types of
goods and services desired and consumer habits. Respondents were
queried on their overall personal satisfaction as well as their
satisfaction with their friendships, family life, marriage, standard
of living, housing, household income, health, education, neighbors,
job, leisure time, public safety, the condition of the environment,
the social welfare system, and the political system. Data were
gathered on the respondents' personal priorities and those they had
for their children, as well as their level of trust in others, their
inclination to help others, and what characteristics and affiliations
they used to identify themselves. Respondents were asked to rate the
efficacy of their national governments in handling the economy,
political corruption, human rights, unemployment, crime, public
services, immigration, ethnic conflict, religious conflict, and
environmental problems. Additional questions asked whether government
officials were responsive to problems of the general population, what
type of political systems respondents favored, and the extent to which
the national government, the local government, the army, the legal
system, the police, the national legislative branch (e.g., Parliament,
Congress), the public education system, large domestic companies,
multinational companies, trade/labor unions, the media, and other
nongovernmental organizations (e.g., environmental, social advocacy
groups, and nonprofit organizations) could be trusted to operate in
the best interests of society. Participants were asked which
macro-socioeconomic issues they were most concerned with and what
matters they believed the government should spend more or less on.
Respondents were polled on their level of personal involvement in
political, governmental, and community affairs, the inclusiveness of
the government, and their perspectives on the importance of political
and electoral participation. Additional questions addressed respondent
exposure to and opinions of foreign companies, peoples, governments,
and cultures. Market analysis inquiries included what products
respondents owned, planned to own in the near future, or desired to
own, as well as what consumer services they had used or would like to
use. Respondents were asked about their modes of transportation, their
current types of residence, whether or not they planned to own their
own residences, and the availability of public utilities. Respondents
were surveyed on what foreign and domestic companies they were
familiar with and which forms of media they used to obtain consumer
and political information. Background information includes age, sex,

3103,"This survey of prosecutors was undertaken to describe
current practice and identify ""promising practices"" with respect to
cases involving domestic violence and child victims or witnesses. It
sought to answer the following questions: (1) What are the challenges
facing prosecutors when children are exposed to domestic violence? (2)
How are new laws regarding domestic violence committed in the presence of
children, now operating in a small number of states, affecting
practice? (3) What can prosecutors do to help battered women and their
children? To gather data on these topics, the researchers conducted a
national telephone survey of prosecutors. Questions asked include case
assignment, jurisdiction of the prosecutor's office, caseload,
protocol for coordinating cases, asking about domestic violence when
investigating child abuse cases, asking about children when
investigating domestic violence cases, and how the respondent found
out when a child abuse case involved domestic violence or when a
domestic violence case involved children. Other variables cover
whether police routinely checked for prior Child Protective Services
(CPS) reports, if these cases were heard by the same judge, in the
same court, and were handled by the same prosecutor, if there were
laws identifying exposure to domestic violence as child abuse, if
there were laws applying or enhancing criminal penalties when children
were exposed to domestic violence, if the state legislature was
considering any such action, if prosecutors were using other avenues
to enhance penalties, if there was pertinent caselaw, and if the
respondent's office had a no-drop policy for domestic violence
cases. Additional items focus on whether the presence of children
influenced decisions to prosecute, if the office would report or
prosecute a battered woman who abused her children, or failed to
protect her children from abuse or from exposure to domestic violence,
how often the office prosecuted such women, if there was a batterers'
treatment program in the community, how often batterers were sentenced
to attend the treatment program, if there were programs to which the
respondent could refer battered mothers and children, what types of
programs were operating, and if prosecutors had received training on
domestic violence issues.","['domestic violence', 'child victims', 'prosecutor challenges', 'legal practices', 'national survey', 'case coordination', 'legal enhancements', 'no-drop policy', ""batterers' treatment"", 'prosecution decisions']","['abuse allegations', 'battered women', 'child abuse', 'domestic assault', 'domestic violence', 'intimate partner violence', 'prosecution', 'restraining orders', 'victim services', 'violence against women']","child victims,prosecutor challenges,legal practices,national survey,case coordination,legal enhancements,no-drop policy,batterers' treatment,prosecution decisions"

Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms.

25865,"In 1985, the Teens, Crime, and the Community and Community Works (TCC/CW) program, a collaborative effort by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and Street Law, Inc., was developed in an effort to reduce adolescent victimization. The purpose of the study was to assess whether the TCC/CW program was successfully implemented and whether it achieved its desired outcome, namely to reduce adolescent victimization. Following an extensive effort to identify potential sites for inclusion in the TCC/CW program outcome evaluation, a quasi-experimental five-wave panel study of public school students was initiated in the fall of 2004. Classrooms in the sample were matched by teacher or subject and one-half of the classrooms received the TCC/CW curriculum while the other half (the control group) was not exposed to the curriculum.

6002,"This survey was conducted as part of an evaluation of the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Health Care for the Uninsured Program
(HCUP), a program whose primary focus was the development and marketing
of affordable health insurance products for small businesses. The
survey investigated the number and types of small businesses that
offered and did not offer insurance, the number and types of employees
of small businesses who received and did not receive insurance, and
whether the employers and employees participating in HCUP were
different from those with other types of insurance or from those with
no insurance. In addition, the survey was designed to test several
hypotheses: whether employers facing an inelastic demand for their
product or a tight labor market would be more likely to offer health
insurance to their employees, and whether higher wages substitute for
health insurance for certain groups of highly skilled or unionized
workers. Firm-level data collected by the survey include number of
permanent and temporary employees, employee turnover, fringe benefits
offered to full- and part-time employees (e.g., paid vacation, paid
sick leave, long-term disability insurance, life insurance, retirement
plan, group health insurance), type of business, number of years owner
had owned the company, age and legal form of the company, and gross
revenue. Extensive information on health insurance was obtained from
firms offering this benefit: total monthly premium paid for health
insurance, percent of premium paid by the company, reasons that
influenced the decision to provide health insurance, whether a Health
Maintenance Organization (HMO) insurance plan was offered, whether a
deductible or co-payment was required for hospital inpatient services,
and whether hospital room and board, physician office visits, maternity
care, prescription drugs, inpatient mental health treatment, or
substance abuse treatment were covered. These firms were also queried
about recent changes in the number of health plan enrollees,
deductibles, co-insurance rates, benefits offered, employer premium
share, recent changes in health insurance carriers and reasons for
changing, and recent increases in premiums and their effects on the
firm's prices, profits, wages, and number of employees. Companies not
offering health insurance were asked why they did not offer this
benefit and were queried about factors that might influence them to
offer a health plan. Individual-level data on employees include sex,
age, marital status, length of employment, number of hours worked
during the last week, salary or wage, health plan participation, amount
of health premium paid by the employee, and whether the employee had
health coverage from another source.","['health insurance', 'small businesses', 'employee benefits', 'hcup evaluation', 'insurance affordability', 'labor market', 'fringe benefits', 'health plan changes', 'insurance coverage', 'premium costs']","['employee benefits', 'health care costs', 'health care providers', 'health care services', 'health insurance', 'insurance coverage', 'labor market', 'premium costs', 'small businesses', 'unemployment insurance']","hcup evaluation,insurance affordability,fringe benefits,health plan changes,premium costs"

7591,"This data collection contains survey data gathered from 90
chemical and metalworking (light engineering) industries in Ecuador,
Peru, and Colombia in 1975, five years after the Andean Group (a
regional subgroup of the Latin American Free Trade Association)
instituted Decision 24, a policy that regulated foreign investment in
member countries. The three countries with firms represented in the
study were national political economies characterized by different
degrees of industrialization and hence different configurations of
sociopolitical forces. They were also relatively politically stable
during the five-year period before the survey, thereby implying a
greater measure of continuity in the application of Decision 24 than
was observed in the other Andean Group countries of Chile and Bolivia,
or Venezuela, which did not join the Andean Group until 1973. Also,
because of the application of Law 444 in Colombia and the General Law
of Industries and ITINTEC in Peru, it was anticipated that managers in
those two countries would be more conscious of the range of choice
available in the selection of technology and that firms would have
recently begun to increase the level of in-house R&amp;D activities. The
chemical and metalworking industries fell within the ambit of Andean
industrial programming activities, so managers in those industries
were expected to represent a group of relatively well-informed persons
with respect to Andean Group issues. The data were obtained from an
orally administered, primarily open-ended questionnaire given to
managers of the selected firms. The survey's data measure: (1) the
size of the firm in terms of assets, earnings, employment, and sales,
(2) the ownership structure of the firm and changes over time, (3)
self-evaluation of future market position and development plans, (4)
source of technology, including explanation of the choice, cost of
technology (royalties), and date for all licenses, (5) R&amp;D activities
and expenditures of the firm, (6) firm's relationship to the
integrative system (imports from and exports to other Andean countries
and the world), and (7) attitudes of firm managers toward Decision 24
and toward attempts by government to regulate Direct Foreign
Investment (DFI) and Technology Transfer.","['andean group', 'decision 24', 'foreign investment', 'industrialization differences', 'political stability', 'technology selection', 'in-house r&d', 'industrial programming', 'ownership structure', 'technology transfer']","['foreign direct investment', 'foreign investments', 'industrialization', 'international trade', 'ownership', 'political stability', 'technology transfer', 'trade agreements', 'trade barriers', 'trade policy']","andean group,decision 24,industrialization differences,political stability,technology selection,in-house r&d,industrial programming,ownership structure"

37275,"The purpose of the completed project was to follow the first National Elder Mistreatment Study, which provided prevalence estimates, with a second study of a subset of the same participants to measure the effects of elder abuse in terms of (1) health and mental health outcomes and (2) criminal justice system participation and satisfaction, as well as to specify additional predictors of these effects. Data were collected from 774 older adults 8 years following their participation in Wave I of the NEMS. This represented the results of contacting every locatable participant who reported psychological, physical, or sexual (but not financial) abuse at Wave I (achieved subsample n = 183 of the original 753 Wave I victims) and a comparison sample of 591 randomly selected Wave I non-victims from the remaining 2,149 working phone numbers of the original 5,024 non-victims (at Wave I). As mentioned, financial abuse classification at Wave I was not used to identify the victim subgroup prior to sampling, however retrospective analysis indicated that the two aforementioned sampling groups (every working phone number of Wave I victims of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse AND every working phone number of the 2,149 comparison Wave I participants) accounted for all but 7 financial abuse victims identified as such at Wave I (i.e., no other financial abuse victims at Wave I could have possibly been re-contacted). The cooperation rate (upon contact), for Wave I victims of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse was 66%; the cooperation rate of comparison Wave I participants was 57%. (Note: it had originally been proposed to conduct propensity matching once the sample of Wave I victims was re-contacted, however by conserving funds during this first phase, the study was able to expand from propensity matching to random selection of a much larger group of over 2,149, for a final derived sample of 774.)","['elder abuse study', 'health outcomes', 'mental health', 'criminal justice', 'predictors of abuse', 'data collection', 'longitudinal research', 'abuse prevalence', 'sampling methodology', 'cooperation rates']","['abuse prevention', 'criminal justice system', 'data collection', 'elder abuse', 'health services utilization', 'longitudinal studies', 'mental health services', 'prevalence studies', 'sampling', 'victim services']","elder abuse study,health outcomes,criminal justice,predictors of abuse,data collection,longitudinal research,abuse prevalence,sampling methodology,cooperation rates"
3427,"This survey was conducted by RAND between November 1999 and
 January 2000. The purpose of this data collection was to obtain a
 detailed view of the present attitudes and opinions of consumers
 regarding health care and to inform the development of the quality
 improvement program being developed by the California HealthCare
 Foundation (CHCF). The mission of the CHCF is to expand access to
 affordable, quality health care for under-served individuals and
 communities, and to promote fundamental improvements in the health
 status of the people of California. This survey sampled over 4,000
 Californians, and allowed a close-up view of difficult to reach and
 traditionally under-served populations: the elderly, the chronically
 ill, the uninsured, low-income populations, and Hispanics. The general
 scope of the information gathered included consumer beliefs about
 adequacy of health care information they received, preferences for
 additional types and sources of information, evaluation of the quality
 of existing information sources, and how they used information about
 health. Respondents were asked a series of detailed questions about
 whether they were concerned about health care, whether they were
 experiencing difficulty in choosing health plans or physicians or
 deciding upon treatment options, whether there were good, available
 sources of information about health care, and whom they trusted to
 give them advice about health care. Background information on
 respondents includes health status, utilization of care, language,

2753,"In response to several high profile, violent crimes by
 minority males, which were reported by law enforcement officials as
 being gang-related, Nevada lawmakers enacted an array of anti-gang
 legislation, much of it drafted by law enforcement personnel. This
 study attempted to provide answers to the following research
 questions: (1) How often and under what specific conditions were the
 various anti-gang statutes used in the prosecution of gang members?
 (2) How had the passage of anti-gang statutes and the development of
 the gang prosecution units influenced the use of more conventional
 charging practices related to gang cases? and (3) Did specialized gang
 prosecution produce higher rates of convictions, more prison
 sentences, and longer prison terms for gang offenders? Court
 monitoring data were collected from both Clark and Washoe counties to
 document the actual extent and nature of gang crime in both
 jurisdictions over several years. Variables include the year of the
 court case, whether the defendant was a gang member, total number of
 initial charges, whether all charges were dismissed before trial,
 whether the defendant was convicted of any charge, the length of the
 prison sentence imposed, whether the defendant was charged with a gang
 enhancement statute, and whether the defendant was charged with
 murder, sexual assault, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, auto theft,
 larceny, a drug offense, a weapon offense, or assault. Demographic

2706,"This study investigated the accuracy of self-reported drug
 use in three ways. First, the researchers examined differences in the
 accuracy of self-reported drug use across five factors: gender, race,
 age, type of drug, and offense seriousness. Second, an attempt was
 made to determine the specific sources of inaccurate self-reports in
 terms of differences in underreporting and overreporting. Third, the
 researchers sought to explain differences in underreporting and
 overreporting in terms of true differences or differences in
 opportunity to underreport or overreport. This study used data
 collected in 1994 as part of the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) Program
 [DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997
 (ICPSR 9477)]. The DUF drug testing and measurement methodology
 allows the accuracy of self-reported drug use to be checked with a
 biological criterion, namely urine tests. The sample for this study
 consisted of 4,752 white and Black adults from Indianapolis,
 Ft. Lauderdale, Phoenix, and Dallas. The five exogenous measures
 included in this study were type of drug (marijuana vs.
 crack/cocaine), age (18 through 30 vs. 31 or over), offense
 seriousness (misdemeanor vs. felony), race (Black vs. white), and
 gender (male vs. female). The endogenous measures were accuracy
 (self-report and drug test both positive or both negative
 vs. otherwise), underreporting (self-report negative but drug test
 positive vs. otherwise), and overreporting (self-report positive but
 drug test negative vs. otherwise). Variables include result of
 marijuana urine test, result of cocaine/crack urine test, marijuana
 self-report, cocaine/crack self-report, age group, sex, race, offense
category, and ethnic/gender group.","['self-reported drug use', 'accuracy assessment', 'biological criterion', 'urine tests', 'drug use forecasting', 'demographic factors', 'underreporting analysis', 'overreporting analysis', 'substance type', 'offense seriousness']","['drug abuse', 'drug courts', 'drug dependence', 'drug education', 'drug law offenses', 'drug testing', 'drug traffic', 'drug treatment', 'drug use', 'substance abuse']","self-reported drug use,accuracy assessment,biological criterion,urine tests,drug use forecasting,demographic factors,underreporting analysis,overreporting analysis,substance type,offense seriousness"

<p>ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly), 1999-2008 was a multisite randomized controlled trial conducted at six field sites with New England Research Institutes (NERI) as the coordinating center. The field sites included the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Hebrew Senior Life (formerly Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged) in Boston, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Pennsylvania State University, and Wayne State University (Detroit).
Data in this study are drawn from measures of cognitively demanding daily activities performed by participants who received a variety of cognitive interventions. Measures included both cognitive functioning (memory, inductive reasoning, speed processing, and general knowledge) and daily functioning (everyday problem solving, observations of daily living, complex reaction time, and general functional ability). Secondary to these measures, the study also includes data on health care and service utilization, driving habits, and mobility.
Data were collected at the start of the study (baseline) as well as one, two, three, five, and ten years into the study. This collection includes the data from the tenth year of the study as well as a comprehensive analytical dataset, incorporating data from the previous collections (data from previous waves of the study as well as participant demographic data can be found in ICPSR 4248). A total of 2,832 older adults were enrolled in the trial, and 2,802 were included in the analytical sample.

22642,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the integrity of sentencing outcomes under alternative state guideline systems and to investigate how this variation in structure impacted actual sentencing practice.  The research team sought to address the question, to what extent do sentencing guidelines contribute to the goals of consistency, proportionality, and a lack of discrimination.  The National Center for State Courts conducted an examination of sentencing patterns in three states with substantially different guidelines systems: Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia.  The three states vary along critical dimensions of the presumptive versus voluntary nature of guidelines as well as basic mechanics. There are differences in the formal design, administration, and statutory framework of the Michigan, Minnesota, and Virginia sentencing systems. For the 2004 Michigan Sentencing Outcomes Data (Part 1), the Michigan Department of Corrections Offender Management Network Information System (OMNI) provided sentencing guideline data for 32,754 individual offenders sentenced during calendar year 2004. For the 2002 Minnesota Sentencing Outcomes Data (Part 2), the Minnesota Sentencing Commission provided data for 12,978 individual offenders sentenced in calendar year 2002. The Virginia Sentencing Commission provided the Fiscal Year 2002 Virginia Assault Sentencing Outcomes Data (Part 3) and the Fiscal Year 2002 Virginia Burglary Sentencing Outcomes Data (Part 4). The Assault and Burglary/Dwelling crime groups have 1,614 and 1,743 observations, respectively.  Variables in the four datasets are classified into the broad categories of conviction offense severity, prior record, offense seriousness, grid cell type, habitual/modifiers, departure, and extra guideline variables.","['sentencing guidelines', 'state comparison', 'guideline integrity', 'sentencing consistency', 'sentencing proportionality', 'discrimination avoidance', 'sentencing practice', 'data analysis', 'offense severity', 'prior record']","['appeal procedures', 'appellate courts', 'discrimination', 'judicial decision making', 'probation officers', 'sentencing', 'sentencing guidelines', 'sentencing reform', 'sentencing reforms', 'verdicts']","state comparison,guideline integrity,sentencing consistency,sentencing proportionality,discrimination avoidance,sentencing practice,data analysis,offense severity,prior record"

This poll surveyed 649 respondents first interviewed March 18-22, 2010, in the CBS News Monthly Poll, March 2010 [<a href=""http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/31566"">ICPSR 31566</a>]. This dataset contains responses to the call-back questions as well as to questions in the original poll, which asked whether they approved of the way that Barack Obama was handling his job as president, the economy, and health care, whether they approved of the way Congress was handling its job, and whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. Respondents were queried on how closely they had been following the health care legislation being debated in Congress, whether they approved of health care reform, whether they thought that the health care reform bill would personally effect them, whether they understood the health care reform bill, and whether they thought that the health care bill would make health care better or worse in the next few years. Respondents were also asked whether they thought that the health care reform bill would make sure that health insurance companies would provide health coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions, help control the cost of health care premiums, and lead to too much government involvement in the health care system. Information was collected on whether respondents thought Congress spent too much time dealing with health care reform, whether they thought that Republicans and Democrats have been trying to pass or defeat the health care bill because it was good policy or mainly for political reasons, and whether they thought that the rules and procedures used in Congress to pass health care reform were fair or not. Respondents were also asked how they thought things were going for the United States in its efforts to bring stability and order to Iraq, how they thought things were going for the United States in the war in Afghanistan, and their views on abortion. Finally, respondents were asked whether they had some form of health insurance and whether they were covered by health insurance through an employer, a union, a personal plan, or through Medicare or Medicaid. In the call-back poll, respondents were re-interviewed on whether they were surprised that the health care reform bill passed, whether they approved of the way that Obama was handling his job as president and health care reform. Respondents were asked how closely they had been following health care legislation that had been debated in Congress, whether they approved or disapproved of the health care reform bill, whether they thought that the health care reform bill personally helped or hurt them, whether they thought that the health care reform bill represented an accomplishment for Obama's presidency and for the Democratic Party, and whether they felt they had a good understanding of how the health care reform bill would affect them and their family. Respondents were also asked if they approved of the way Democrats and Republicans in Congress were handling health care, whether they were disappointed that the final vote on health care did not have more bipartisan support, whether they think Republicans in Congress should continue to challenge parts of the health care bill, whether they thought that the health care reform bill would make the health care system better in the next few years, and whether they thought the health care reform bill would increase or decrease the federal budget deficit. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, marital status, education level, household income, religious preference, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status, and whether respondents thought of themselves as born again Christians.","['public opinion', 'presidential approval', 'health care reform', 'congressional performance', 'political polarization', 'policy impact', 'legislative process', 'public understanding', 'insurance coverage', 'demographic information']","['health care reform', 'health care services', 'health insurance', 'insurance coverage', 'legislative process', 'political polarization', 'presidential approval', 'public opinion', 'public policy', 'public understanding']","congressional performance,political polarization,policy impact,public understanding,demographic information"
